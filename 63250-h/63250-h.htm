<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET TREVENNON was young and
beautiful. Her faithful biographer can
say no less, though aware of the possibility
that, on this account, the satiated reader of
romances may make her acquaintance with a
certain degree of reluctance, reflecting upon the
two well-worn types&mdash;the maiden in the first
flush of youth, who is so immaculately lovely as
to be extremely improbable, and the maturer
female, who is so strong-minded as to be wholly
ineligible to romantic situations. If there be
only these two classes Miss Trevennon must
needs be ranged with the former. Certainly
the particular character of her beauty foreordained
her to romantic situations, although
it must be said, on the other hand, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
term &#8220;strong-minded&#8221; was one which had
been more than once applied to her by those
who should have known her best.</p>

<p>She lived with her parents on the outskirts
of a small Southern town, in a dilapidated old
house, that had once been a grand mansion.
The days of its splendid hospitality had passed
away long since, and as far back as Margaret&#8217;s
memory went the same monotonous tranquillity
had pervaded its lofty corridors and spacious
rooms. In spite of this, however, it was a
pleasant, cheerful home, and the girl&#8217;s life, up
to her nineteenth year, had been passed very
happily in it. She had had occasional changes
of scene, such as a visit to New Orleans or a
brief season at some small Southern watering-place;
but she had never been North, and so
by birth and circumstance, as well as by instinct
and training, she was a genuine Southern
girl. The fact that Mr. Trevennon had
managed to save from the wreck of his large
fortune a small independence, had afforded his
daughter the opportunity of seeing something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of men and manners beyond her own hearthstone,
and this, together with her varied and
miscellaneous reading, gave her a range of
vision wider and higher than that enjoyed by
the other young people of Bassett, and had
imbued her with certain theories and opinions
which made them regard her as eccentric.</p>

<p>One bright autumnal day, when the weather
was still warm and sunny in this fair Southern
climate, Miss Trevennon, clad in an airy white
costume, and protected from the sun by a veil
and parasol, took her way with the rather
quick motions usual with her, down the main
street of Bassett. When she reached the corner
on which Martin&#8217;s drug store was situated,
she crossed over and passed down on the opposite
side; but, doubly screened as she was,
she turned her eyes in that direction and took
a hurried survey of the loungers assembled
on the pavement. Perhaps it was because her
gaze especially sought him out that she saw
Charley Somers first. This was a young man
who had been her unrequited adorer, hoping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
against hope, ever since they had gone to the
village school together, and Margaret had all
her life been trying, in a flashing, impetuous
way that she had, to fire him with some of the
energy and enthusiasm which she herself possessed
so abundantly, and in which this pleasant,
easy, indolent young Southerner was so absolutely
lacking. Young Somers had come of a
long line of affluent and luxurious ancestors,
and though cut off from an inheritance in their
worldly possessions, he had fallen heir to
many of their personal characteristics, which
hung about him like fetters of steel.</p>

<p>Although Miss Trevennon hurriedly averted
her gaze after that one swift glance, she had
received a distinct impression of Mr. Somers&#8217;
whole manner and attitude, as he sat with his
chair tipped back against the wall, his heels
caught on its topmost round, his straw hat
pushed back from his delicate, indolent face,
and a pipe between his lips. In this way he
would sit for hours, ringing the changes on the
somewhat restricted theme of county politics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
with the loungers who frequented &#8220;Martin&#8217;s.&#8221;
The mere thought of it, much more
the sight, infuriated Miss Trevennon. She
could not grow accustomed to it, in spite of
long habituation.</p>

<p>As she tripped along, erect and quick, she
heard a familiar footstep behind her, and in a
moment more was joined by the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he said, giving
his hat a little careless push and re-settlement,
without lifting it from his head. &#8220;May
I go with you and carry your basket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you like,&#8221; said Margaret, distantly, yielding
up to him the little white-covered basket.
&#8220;I am going to see Uncle Mose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As usual! What has Uncle Mose done to
be so petted? I wish you would treat me with
half as much consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you entitled to it,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Uncle Mose is at the end of a long
life of continuous, patient labor, and has won
a right to my consideration, which you never
have. You have often heard me say, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
that ever since I&#8217;ve been able to form an opinion
at all, I&#8217;ve been a thorough-going Abolitionist;
but all the same, I think there is virtue
in a system which <i>makes</i> a man work,
whether he wills it or not. Servitude itself
seems to me a nobler life than absolute idleness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the same old thing!&#8221; said the young
man, wearily. &#8220;I wonder when you will give
up expecting me to be a paragon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given it up long ago. I&#8217;ve seen the
futility of any such expectation; but I will
never give up wishing that you would be a
man, and do something worthy of a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t work. I attend to my
cases, and am always on hand during court
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Provided it doesn&#8217;t clash with fishing
week or hunting week, or any pursuit that
happens to offer a more attractive prospect
than that of discussing county politics and
smoking bad tobacco with some other loungers
at &#8216;Martin&#8217;s&#8217;!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>&#8220;I know I am not what you like,&#8221; said Somers despondently;
&#8220;but there is one thing that
would make me different. If you would give
me some hope for the future&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begged you never to say that again,&#8221; interrupted
Margaret, quickly. &#8220;You know how
indignant it makes me, and the worst of it is
that you really believe it to be true. If you
won&#8217;t do right for right&#8217;s sake, you would never
do it for mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no answer to her words. But one
form of response suggested itself, and to that
he knew she was in no mood to listen; so,
for the space of a few moments, they walked
along in silence. But Margaret&#8217;s thoughts
were very active, and presently she broke out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Charley, when I heard you complaining
the other day, that the tailor who has a
shop opposite you kept you from sleeping in
the morning by his violin practice begun at
daylight, I remembered how you had told me
once that you frequently saw him at his work
until after midnight; and do you know what I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
thought? I thought: I wish to goodness
Charley would try to be a little more like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; the young man cried,
angrily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you are talking
about. Do you think I could ever so far forget
myself as to imitate a beastly little Yankee
tailor, or to desire to be like him in any way
whatever? I can stand a good deal from you,
Margaret, but this is a little too much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! His happening to be a Yankee
puts him down at once. But I can tell you
what it is, Charley, there is one lesson you
might profitably learn from him, and that the
most important in the world for you. It is, to
make something of the powers you have. That
poor little man has no possibilities, I suppose,
beyond the attainment of a certain degree of
skill in making clothing, on the one hand, and
learning to play popular airs indifferently on a
cracked little fiddle, on the other. But with
you, how different it is! Papa says you would
be an able lawyer, but for the trifling obstacle
that you don&#8217;t know any law. We all know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
how well you talk, on those rare occasions on
which you become really interested. And as
to the other point, the music&mdash;oh, Charley,
what mightn&#8217;t your voice become, if you would
avail yourself of the means of cultivation within
your reach? But no! Your teacher told you
that you must practise patiently and continuously
to procure its proper development, and
this you would not do; it was too troublesome!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble apart,&#8221; said Somers, &#8220;the notion
does not please me, and I must say I wonder
that you, who make such a point of manliness
in a man, should favor any one&#8217;s regularly preparing
himself to be the sort of drawing-room
pet that one of your trained song-singers is
certain to become.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>can</i> say the most aggravating things!&#8221;
said Margaret. &#8220;Is it possible that you can
consider it unmanly to cultivate such a gift as
that? But what&#8217;s the use of all this? You
don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t care much,&#8221; he answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
slowly. &#8220;When a man has one supreme, paramount
care forever possessing him, and is
constantly being told that the object of his desires
is beyond his reach, other things don&#8217;t
matter very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sight of the weary discontent on his
handsome face, her heart softened, and as they
stopped before the little cabin, which was
their destination, she said kindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in and see Uncle Mose with me,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the young man excused himself rather
hurriedly, and delivering the basket into her
hands he said good-morning, and walked rapidly
back toward the town.</p>

<p>Margaret pushed open the door of the wretched
little cabin, and just within sat Uncle Mose,
engaged in his customary avocation of shoemaking,
or to speak more accurately, shoe-mending.
He was a spare and sinewy old
negro, whose age, according to his own account,
was &#8220;somewhar high up in de nineties.&#8221; He
was much bowed in figure, and lame in one leg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Bushy tufts of dull gray hair rose on each side
of his brown and polished crown, and his
wrinkled and sunken cheeks were quite beardless.
His expression was one of placid benevolence
and contentment&mdash;a strange contrast to
his surroundings. The room he occupied was
hideously squalid and confused. The roof
sloped in one direction and the floor in another,
and the stove, which was unreasonably
large, in a third. Old phials, suspended by
their necks and partly filled with muddy liquids,
decorated the walls, together with a pair
of patched boots, a string of red peppers,
several ears of pop-corn, and a leather-covered
whipstock. In one corner hung a huge walking
cane. Everything was thickly coated with
dust.</p>

<p>The old man was seated near the perilously
one-sided stove, in which a fire smoked and
smouldered, though it was a balmy day, and in
front of which a rusty old iron spade did duty
for a door. His few old tools and pegs and
twines were on a broken chair beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
When he looked up, over the top of his brass-rimmed
spectacles, and saw who his visitor was,
he broke into a broad smile of welcome, as he
raised his withered old hand to his head in
token of salutation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat you, missis?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What bin
fetch you out dis time o&#8217; day? I is glad to see
you, sho&#8217;. Come in, en take a seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swept his tools and twines from the
wooden seat to the floor, and rubbed the dusty
surface several times with his hard palm. Margaret
at once sat down, laying her long white
draperies across her lap, to protect them from
the dusty floor, showing a pair of neat little
boots as she did so. Then she took off the
cover of the basket, and revealed its contents
to the old man&#8217;s delighted gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, missis, to be sho&#8217;!&#8221; he exclaimed, his
features relaxing in a grin of anticipative enjoyment,
&#8220;Light bread, en chicken, en grapes!
en what&#8217;s dis, missis? Gemarna!<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Whoo!
How come you bin know so good what I done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
bin hankerin&#8217; arter? I gwine tase a little,
right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And using his shoemaking weapon as knife,
fork and spoon indifferently, he fell to in earnest.
He had probably been honest in his intention
of only tasting a little, feeling it perhaps
a lack of decorum to eat in the presence
of his guest; but once embarked on the alluring
enterprise, he was in no humor to relax,
and, uttering from time to time expressive ejaculations
of enjoyment, he went on and on, until
only the fruit remained. As he wiped his
mouth on the back of his hand, he drew a long
sigh of contented repletion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat wor good, sure &#8217;nuff, missis,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;White folks&#8217; vittles tase mighty chice to me
now, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you liked it, Uncle Mose,&#8221; said
Margaret. &#8220;But tell me&mdash;I always meant to
ask you&mdash;where that immense stick came from.
Did any one ever use it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, dat air ole stick, missis? Why, bress
you, honey, dat air ole stick wor ole mars&#8217;r&#8217;s,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
whar he bin use ter take when he druv out in
de kyarrge, arter he bin git so big en fat. Yes,
missis; he bin put he han&#8217;s on de top en res&#8217;
he chin on &#8217;em, en when I bin had ter git out&#8217;n
de ole place, de bin gin it ter me fur a sort o&#8217;
memorandum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were mighty fond of your old master,
weren&#8217;t you, Uncle Mose?&#8221; asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, dat&#8217;s a fac&#8217;, missis&mdash;dat&#8217;s a fac&#8217;. Ole
mars&#8217;r war mighty good to us. De wor three
hund&#8217;rd on us, en he wor de mars&#8217;r, en we had
ter know it. He done bin gin he niggers
mighty good chance, ole mars&#8217;r is. Ebery
man bin had he pig en he chickens, en ole
mars&#8217;r he buy de young chickens en de eggs,
en pay us de market price fur &#8217;em. Yes,
missis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you do with the money,
Uncle Mose?&#8221; Margaret asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress my wife, missis. Lor&#8217; yes, dress my
wife, en Queen. Queen war my oldes&#8217; daughter;
en if you b&#8217;lieve me, missis, I dress dem
two niggers same as de done bin white. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
bin lucky nigger all my life, missis. Ole mars&#8217;r
wor good enough, en when he bin die en young
Rawjer take de place, t&#8217;war mos&#8217; same as hebben.
I dunno <i>how</i> come young Rawjer wor so
mile, for all he par wor so blusterin&#8217;. You see
ole mars&#8217;r he mighty quick en hot-heddy. He
let out at you sometimes, en hawler &#8217;twel you
think he gwine tar you to pieces; but done
you be skeered, missis; he ain&#8217; gwine hit you
a lick. When de new overseers&#8217;d come, ole
mars&#8217;r he &#8217;low de mus&#8217; keep us down en work
us hard, but Lor&#8217; missis, he ain&#8217; mean it. He
gwine watch mighty close nobody don&#8217; &#8217;buse
his niggers, en he giv&#8217; &#8217;em plenty good food to
eat, and see it done bin cook right, too. De
did&#8217;n have no plates en knives to eat with. No
missis; but what dem niggers want long o&#8217;
plates en knives? De ain&#8217; got no right to complain
cause de ain&#8217; eat offn chany. De needn&#8217;t
think ole mars&#8217;r gwine let em come sit down at
his table long o&#8217; him, &#8217;kus he worn&#8217; gwine do it,
en he <i>did&#8217;n</i> do it. No, missis.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s tone was one of vehement indorsement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
of his master&#8217;s policy, that there
could be no mistaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you marry one of your own master&#8217;s
slaves, Uncle Mose?&#8221; asked Margaret, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, missis,&#8221; Uncle Mose responded blandly;
&#8220;I marry a gal whar &#8217;long to one Mr. <i>Fitz</i>hugh.
De war heap o&#8217; likely gals whar &#8217;long
to ole mars&#8217;r, some bright yaller, and some
black ez coals, en some mos&#8217; white, but seem
like I could&#8217;n make up my mine to marry air
one on &#8217;em, I dunno <i>what</i> make I could&#8217;n
take to &#8217;em, but &#8217;t&#8217;war no use! I bin sot my
eyes on a tall black gal, over to Mars&#8217;r George
<i>Fitz</i>hugh&#8217;s, en ebery other Sad&#8217;dy ole mars&#8217;r
lemme knock off early en go see her. She
done bin younger&#8217;n me, some odd yeers, en I
tell her I wor&#8217;n&#8217; gwine cheat &#8217;er. I tell her
she mought look roun&#8217; a while, &#8217;fo&#8217; we bin
settle de thing. So, eff you b&#8217;lieve me, missis,
I bin wait on her three yeers, &#8217;fo&#8217; she compose
her mine to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what became of her?&#8221; said Margaret,
as he paused ruminatively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>&#8220;Alter &#8217;bout fo&#8217; yeers, missis, she wor sole
away, Liza wor,&#8221; he said in tones as benign
and free from resentment as ever. &#8220;Lor&#8217; me,
missis, how well I mine dat day! I bin&#8217; come
up from de fiel&#8217; like t&#8217;wor down datterway&#8221;
(suiting the action to the word), &#8220;de paff run
long by de cabin do&#8217; pretty much. It wor like
it done bin dis pass Chewsdy dat I come up
to de do&#8217;, en Aun&#8217; Tetsy, she tell me she heer
&#8217;Liza done bin sole. I stop short like, en I say
&#8216;<i>what?</i>&#8217; en she tell me agin, en say she bin
heer&#8217;d de done fotch her down to town ter take
her off in de drove. I struck out for de great-&#8217;us
at dat, en I tell ole mars&#8217;r all &#8217;bout it.
&#8216;Knock off work, Mose,&#8217; ole mars&#8217;r say, &#8216;en go
to town en see eff she&#8217;s thar. &#8217;T&#8217;ain&#8217; no use
try ter keep her, but mebbe you can see her
en de chillun one&#8217;t mo&#8217;. You kin take White-foot.&#8217;
I prick up my yeers at dat, for White-foot
war de fleetes&#8217; horse ole mars&#8217;r got. Lor&#8217;,
missis, I wish yer could &#8217;a see dat filly. De
ain&#8217; no sich hosses now. Her legs war clean
en straight ez a poplar, en her coat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8220;But, Uncle Mose, go on about &#8217;Liza.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;T&#8217;war no use, missis,&#8221; he said, with a patient
head-shake. &#8220;When I got to town I bin
hurry to de jail to see eff de bin lodge de gang
in dar, but de tell me &#8217;Liza bin gone off wid
de rest on &#8217;em dat very mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, and sat staring in front
of him in a preoccupied and ruminative way,
from which Margaret saw it would be necessary
to recall him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;what else, Uncle Mose?&#8221; she said
gently; &#8220;what finally became of your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which wife, missis?&#8221; he replied, rousing
himself by an effort, and looking about him
blankly; &#8220;I had three on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret refrained from asking whether it
had been a case of &#8220;trigamy,&#8221; or whether
they had been successive, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were telling me about &#8217;Liza&#8217;s being
sold away. Did you never see her again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, missis,&#8221; the old man answered gently.
&#8220;I never see &#8217;Liza no mo&#8217;. I see a man whar
met her on de road, en he say she bin had de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
baby in her arms, walkin&#8217; &#8217;long wid de gang, en
de t&#8217;other chile wor in de cart wid de balance o&#8217;
de chillun, en he say &#8217;Liza busted out a-cryin&#8217;,
en &#8217;low he mus&#8217; tell her ole man, eff we did&#8217;n
meet no mo&#8217; here b&#8217;low, she hope to meet in
Hebben. En he ax her den whar she gwine
ter, en she say she dunno, she think she bin
heerd em say t&#8217;wor Alabammer; en dat&#8217;s de
las&#8217; word I ever heer o&#8217; &#8217;Liza. Yes, missis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another meditative pause followed, and
Margaret&#8217;s sympathetic eyes could see that he
was far back in the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bin had a daughter sole away, too, missis,&#8221;
he went on presently. &#8220;Yes, missis. She
&#8217;long to one Mr. Lane. He bin a hard mars&#8217;r,
en he treated on her mighty bad, &#8217;twel arter
while she run off en went en put herself in
jail. Yes, missis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could she put herself in jail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat how de do, missis. You see, when she
bin run away, eff she done git caught, de have
to put her in jail. So she jes&#8217; go en give herself
up, en say she won&#8217; go back ter Mr. Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>&mdash;she
be sole fust! So arter Mr. Lane fine out
she one o&#8217;dat sort, he sole her. It so happen
dat my brother Sawney wor gwine &#8217;long de
road, en she wor passin&#8217; in de cart, en she
hawler out: &#8216;Howdy, Unc&#8217; Sawney!&#8217; en
Sawney say: &#8216;Hi! who dat know me, en I
don&#8217; know dem?&#8217; En she say: &#8216;Lor&#8217; Unc&#8217;
Sawney, don&#8217;t you know Unc&#8217; Mose&#8217;s Queen?&#8217;
En Sawney say: &#8216;Hi, Queen! Dat ain&#8217; you!
Whar you gwine to?&#8217; En she say: &#8216;I dunno,
I ruther fer ter go ennywhere den to stay whar
I done bin.&#8217; En I ain&#8217; never heerd o&#8217; Queen
since.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the old man was seized with a
fit of coughing, which he made great efforts to
repress, and fluently apologized for.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me, young missis,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I bin cotch a bad cole, en it cough me all
day en cough me all night, clar &#8217;twel mornin&#8217;.
I&#8217;se gettin&#8217; mighty ole en shacklin&#8217;. Yes,
missis.</p>

<p>&#8220;De all been mighty good to me, missis,&#8221;
went on Uncle Mose, after a short pause,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
&#8220;from ole mars&#8217;r down. I hope to meet
&#8217;em all in Hebben. Ole mars&#8217;r ain&#8217; bin
much fer religion in he life; but he die a
mighty peaceful, happy death, en he forgive
all he enemies. He bin kind en merciful, en I
&#8217;low de Lord&#8217;ll take him in. He always give
his niggers heap o&#8217; religious encouragement,
en when we bin go to de lick to be <i>bab</i>tize,
he bin gin us de fines&#8217; kind o&#8217; notes to de
preacher, en eff you bin tell a lie or steal a
chicken he ain&#8217; gwine say de fuss word &#8217;bout
it. Ef he come roun&#8217; to de cabin while we bin
had meetin&#8217;, he ain&#8217; gwine make no &#8217;sturbance.
He wait roun&#8217; &#8217;twel we done sing de Doxoligum,
en den he say what he come fer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your religion has been a great comfort to
you, Uncle Mose&mdash;hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Margaret,
making an effort to keep back an irrepressible
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, dat&#8217;s a fac&#8217;, missis&mdash;dat&#8217;s a fac&#8217;, it has.
Sometime it animate me very strong, en make
me tower high &#8217;bove de world; but den agin,
sometime de very las&#8217; bit on it takes to flight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
en ef you b&#8217;lieve me, missis, I ain&#8217; got no more
religion den de palm o&#8217; your han&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The greatest saints have complained of
that, Uncle Mose,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;it is one
of the devil&#8217;s strongest temptations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, ole Sat&#8217;n, missis? Talk to me &#8217;bout
ole Sat&#8217;n! Don&#8217;t I know him? You just give
him de chance en he gwine fight you, mean
enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret, much amused, was about to make
a move to go, when Uncle Mose arrested her
intention by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;En so Mars&#8217; Rawjer got a little gal gwine
git married. Well, well, well! Is I ever bin
tell you, missis, &#8217;bout de time I whip young
Rawjer? Ha! ha! ha! I tell you, missis, I
whale him good. He make me mad one day,
&#8217;bout ketchin de white folks&#8217; hosses, en I
break me a little sprout, whar sprung up &#8217;side
a ole stump, in de very fiel&#8217; I help to clar
forty yeers ago, en I warm he jacket fer him,
good fashion. I mighty feared he gwine tell
he par, but arter I git up by de stable, I does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
take my han&#8217; en slap it &#8217;gin de stone fence, en
one de little white boys say, &#8216;I tell you, Uncle
Mose kin hit hard&#8217;; en I say &#8216;Ah, dat I kin,
chile; dat&#8217;s a fac;&#8217; en eff you b&#8217;lieve me, I
skeered dat chile so bad, he ain&#8217; never tell he
par yit;&#8221; and Uncle Mose went off into a long
chuckle of delight. &#8220;When he bin git married
en bring he wife home, we all went up to
de house to see &#8217;em, en drink de healths, en he
tell de young missis this war Mose whar bin
gin him that air whippin&#8217; he bin tole her
&#8217;bout. She war mighty pretty little thing, wid
yaller hair en great big sof&#8217; blue eyes, en a
little han&#8217; ez sof&#8217; en white ez snow. I was mos&#8217;
feared to ketch hold on it, wid my ole black
paw, but she would shake han&#8217;s wid me, en she
&#8217;lowed maybe t&#8217;wor dat whippin&#8217; what make her
husman sich a good man, en Mars&#8217; Rawjer he
look at her fit to eat her up. She bin use ter
gin out to de han&#8217;s, arter she come, but Aun&#8217;
Kitty she tote de smoke-&#8217;us key.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Margaret rose to take leave, the old man
rose also.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>&#8220;I mighty proud&#8217;n dat dinner you bin fotch
me, missis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Give my &#8217;spects to yo&#8217;
par en mar, en call agin, missis.&#8221; And he lifted
his cap and bowed her out with punctilious
politeness.</p>

<p>As Margaret took her way homeward from
the old negro&#8217;s cabin, she was conscious of a
more than usual softness in her heart for
Uncle Mose and his reminiscences, and all the
customs and traditions of which he was the
exponent. Even Charley Somers seemed less
reprehensible than he had been an hour ago,
for the old man&#8217;s talk had brought before her
mind a system of things of which the inertia
and irresponsibleness that jarred upon her so,
in the people around her, seemed the logical
outgrowth. She had often been told that her
father, when a small boy, had been every day
drawn to and from his school in a diminutive
coach pulled by ten little negroes; and a number
of similar anecdotes which she could recall
gave her an insight into the absolute difference
between that <i>r&eacute;gime</i> and the present, that made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
her somewhat ashamed of her intolerance, and
mollified considerably her feeling toward young
Somers, whom she determined to serve more
kindly at their next interview. She was
prompted further to this resolve by the fact that
she had something to break to the young man,
which she feared would go rather hard with him.</p>

<p>An opportunity which she had often longed
for, to see the great world beyond her own
section of country, and observe the manners
and habits of men and women whose circumstances
and traditions were directly opposed to
her own, had been offered recently by a letter,
received from a cousin who had married an
army officer and was living in Washington,
which conveyed an invitation for her to make
her a visit. Her father and mother highly approved
the plan and it seemed settled that she
was to go, and while she longed for the new
experience, she found her thoughts dwelling
rather tenderly on the dear old home and
friends, of whom, it seemed to her now, she had
been ungratefully impatient.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp;FEW weeks later, Miss Trevennon found
herself domesticated in her cousin&#8217;s house
in Washington, with surroundings so unfamiliar
and circumstances so new to her that she
found something to excite her interest and surprise
almost every hour in the day. The perfect
appointments of the house, which was
gotten up with all the appliances of modern
art, delighted and diverted her at every turn.
&#8220;The mud-scraper,&#8221; she wrote her mother, in
her first letter home, &#8220;is a thing of beauty, and
the coal-scuttle a joy forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no children in the family, which
consisted only of General and Mrs. Gaston and
a bachelor brother of the former, who made
his home with them, although a large portion
of his time was spent in New York. Margaret
had already been an inmate of the house for
ten days, and as yet had not seen him. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Gaston, however, informed her that he might
appear at any moment, his trips to and from
New York being too frequent to entail the formality
of announcing himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston was a very clever and agreeable
woman and pretended, with some reason, to
know the world. Her marriage had been considered
quite a brilliant one, as General Gaston&#8217;s
position, both social and official, was extremely
good, and he had quite a large private
fortune in addition to his pay. He was not
so clever as his wife, but more thoughtful and
perhaps more sincere. It was a successful
marriage, and the Gaston establishment was
tasteful and well ordered. Mrs. Gaston, whose
health was indifferent, kept her room a good
deal when she could escape the exactions of
society, which she never allowed herself to
shirk; and her husband was so much absorbed
in his official and social duties that Margaret
was often alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you are frequently dull, my
dear,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston said to her cousin one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
morning, as the latter sat beside her couch in
the little dressing-room where the invalid was
taking her breakfast. &#8220;It will be brighter for
you when the season fairly opens; but I purposely
begged you to come now, so that we
might have time to make acquaintance while
we are quiet. I wish Louis would come home,
but there&#8217;s never any counting on him, he&#8217;s so
frightfully busy all the time. I never saw a
man work so hard in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked a little puzzled: &#8220;I thought
you told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began,</p>

<p>&#8220;That he is well off? So he is. He has
quite a nice little fortune and there&#8217;s no earthly
reason why he should work so hard, except
that he likes it; and from that point of view I
don&#8217;t blame him. &#8216;Pleasure the way you like
it,&#8217; is an axiom for which I have a profound
respect, and Louis undoubtedly finds his chief
pleasure in application to his profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his profession?&#8221; Margaret asked;
for, although it was evident that Mrs. Gaston
was very fond of her brother-in-law, she had,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
for some reason, said very little about him to
her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an architect&mdash;I thought you knew&mdash;Ames
&amp; Gaston. Have you never heard of
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Margaret, shaking her head and
smiling, &#8220;but that does not go for much. I
am finding out that I have never heard of
most things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really quite delightful that you never
heard of Ames &amp; Gaston,&#8221; said Cousin Eugenia,
laughing. &#8220;I shall inform Louis promptly,
though he won&#8217;t believe it, or if he does
he&#8217;ll set it down to the obtuseness of Southern
people&mdash;a foregone conclusion in his mind! I
must tell you that I anticipate some pleasure
in seeing you enlighten him on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I shall not be able to do much,&#8221;
said Margaret. &#8220;I do feel myself extremely
ignorant by the side of General Gaston and
yourself, especially when you talk of modern
literature and art and music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not, I assure you. We are neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of us more than &#8216;cleverly smattered&#8217; on these
subjects. Edward knows more than I do,
though every one, himself included, believes
the contrary. It&#8217;s quite another thing with
Louis, however; he&#8217;s a swell at that sort of
thing, and is really thorough, and yet, do you
know, I sometimes manage to impose on him
immensely and make him think I&#8217;ve penetrated
to the very root and fibre of a matter, when in
reality I have only the most superficial knowledge
of it? But all this is a digression. There
was something I wanted to say to you. It was
about Edward&#8217;s people. You know about the
Gastons, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked slightly puzzled. &#8220;What
do you mean?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I mean about their name and history
and family traditions. It&#8217;s an old Puritan
family and one of the most illustrious in New
England. I read somewhere the other day, that
it was one of the few really historical families
in America, and I have no desire to speak
disrespectfully of them, only I do think they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
make an unnecessary amount of fuss with themselves.
Oh! I <i>must</i> tell you about my first
interview with Mr. Alexander M. Gaston. You
know who he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I do not,&#8221; said Margaret, lifting her
eyebrows with a deprecating smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>are</i> green! but, however, it&#8217;s unnecessary
to enlighten you now, except to say
that he is Edward&#8217;s uncle, and the head of the
great house of Gaston. He&#8217;s been governor
and senator and foreign minister and all sorts
of things, and is now one of the most eminent
men in New England, and a very excellent and
accomplished gentleman. Well, soon after I
became engaged to Edward he came to call
upon me, and I must say his whole manner
and attitude toward me were rather amazing.
He was good enough to say that he welcomed
me into the family, but he took pains to intimate
that I was about to be the recipient of
a great honor. The Gastons, he explained,
had been for centuries leaders of public thought
and opinion in their own State, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
obliging enough to supply me with the dates
of the landing in New England of the founders
of the house, and to dwell upon their prominence
among the early Puritans. I listened respectfully
to this tirade, and by the time it came
to a conclusion I had my little speech ready,
and when he took my hand and formally welcomed
me into the great house of Gaston, I
replied by saying that I knew it ought to be a
source of much satisfaction to Edward and
myself that we were, in our small way, doing
something toward healing an old breach. &#8216;My
ancestors were Cavaliers,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and for a
Cavalier to marry a Puritan, is, even at this
late day, helping at least a little to wipe out
the memory of a long-standing feud.&#8217; Now, I
flatter myself that was rather neat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cousin Eugenia, how perfectly delicious!&#8221;
exclaimed Margaret, with an outburst
of gay laughter. &#8220;And what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly remember, my dear, but it
was something clever and adroit. I know he
retired very gracefully, and bore me no malice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
He has been very kind to me always, and I am
said to be his favorite of all his nephews&#8217;
wives. He is really a dear old boy, and quite
worthy of all the adulation he receives, if only
they wouldn&#8217;t put it on the ground of ancestry.
Why, the founder of the family was engaged in
some sort of haberdashery business in London!
It&#8217;s odd, the inconsistencies one meets with!
But I&#8217;m inured to it all now, and have learned
to pose as a Gaston, like the rest of them!
But what I wanted particularly to tell you,
and what it concerns you to know is, that the
Gastons&mdash;Edward and Louis as well as the
others&mdash;are greatly prejudiced against Southerners.
That was one reason why I asked you
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may make matters very difficult for me,&#8221;
said Margaret, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least, my dear. You have only
to be yourself, assuming nothing. I feel a delightful
security in letting matters take their
course. You will know perfectly what to do,
and I think nothing could be more inspiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
than forcing people to abandon foolish prejudices.
I should not be sorry to have your
chance myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, the same opportunity must once
have been yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, they won&#8217;t accord me that for a
moment. They say, with truth, that merely to
have been born in the South does not make
me a Southerner, and that, having spent as
much time in the North&mdash;and, for that matter,
the East and West&mdash;as in the South, I must be
set down as a cosmopolitan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost surprised to hear you say they
are prejudiced,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;I should
suppose they were too intelligent for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I&#8217;ve always said. For my part,
I haven&#8217;t an atom of prejudice in my composition.
It is unworthy of enlightened human
beings, and so I tell Edward and Louis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do they say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that they are not prejudiced, of course.
Denial is the only answer such people can
give. But, for all that, they are. I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Northern people, as a rule, are more prejudiced
than Southerners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must go great lengths, if they are,&#8221;
said Margaret; &#8220;but I am not speaking of the
more enlightened ones, and I have always supposed
that the existence of such feelings in
Bassett was due to the fact that it is such a
small place, and so shut off from contact with
the world. And then, too, I think much of it is
to be attributed to the fact that those poor
people suffered so terribly by the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. I often tell Edward and Louis
that they are so much less justifiable, because
they were the victors. I&#8217;m sure <i>I</i> feel it a very
easy thing to be magnanimous toward a person
I&#8217;ve got the better of. But I&#8217;ve long since
ceased to apply arguments to a prejudice.
Finding they did not answer, I thought a practical
illustration might.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s silence ensued, which Margaret
presently broke by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Louis Gaston younger or older than
your husband?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&#8220;Younger, of course,&mdash;years younger. He&#8217;s
not quite thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a bachelor or a widower?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bachelor, of course. Fancy Louis being
a widower! He stands on the high vantage-ground
of lofty impregnability. He is not in
love, and he would fain have it believed he
never has been, or at least only in a careless and
off-hand manner. Not that he avoids women.
On the contrary, he goes into society, and
enjoys it very much when he has time, which
is not very often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that he works out of office
hours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has no particular office hours, and he
works at all times, early and late. His partner
lives in New York and he is there a great
deal, and there most of the work is done; but
he is always drawing plans and making estimates
here at home, and has a branch office
down the street. Sometimes he works in his
room, and sometimes I persuade him to bring
his designs down into the library, when there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
seems a likelihood of our having a quiet evening.
I pretend I&#8217;m interested in them, to
please him,&mdash;he does a great deal to please me;
but I&#8217;m not so, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be interesting to him, at any
rate, to absorb him so completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so! Why, I&#8217;ve known
Louis, when there was a stress of work, to sit
up the entire night, and then take a cold bath
and come down to breakfast perfectly fresh,
and be ready afterward to go off down town
and be at it again until night. It&#8217;s enough to
make one yawn to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston, suiting the action to the word,
was settling herself more comfortably among
the pillows, and so failed to observe the
look of eager interest her words had called
up in her companion&#8217;s face. She had just
arranged her position to her satisfaction, and
turned to continue the conversation, when
a quick step was heard ascending the staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Louis&#8217; step,&#8221; she said suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
&#8220;Close the door, please; he will probably
stop to speak to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret obeyed in silence, and the next
moment the footsteps stopped at the door, and
a very pleasantly modulated voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Any admittance to a repentant renegade,
who comes to make his peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston, quietly; &#8220;I&#8217;m not
well&mdash;worse than usual, indeed&mdash;used up with
recent exertions and in no mood to show clemency
to offenders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray, in what have the recent exertions
consisted?&#8221; the voice replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the usual round of wearing domestic
affairs, with a new item added.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; exclaimed the voice; &#8220;it would
seem the young Southerner has arrived. Is it
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston, dryly, &#8220;she
has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were not too generous, I should say,
&#8216;I told you so,&#8217;&#8221; went on the voice. &#8220;I have
observed that Southern importations into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Northern climates are usually attended with
certain disadvantages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s a very nice little thing,&#8221; said
Mrs. Gaston, carelessly, &#8220;I think something
can be made of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are to have the pleasure of conducting
the process of development, and Edward
and I that of looking on at it&mdash;is that
it? Where is she, by-the-way? Is there any
danger of one&#8217;s meeting her on the stairs, and
having to account for one&#8217;s self? A civilized
man, encountered unexpectedly, might unsteady
the nerves of the Importation&mdash;might
he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston; &#8220;but there&#8217;s
no danger. I&#8217;ve given her a room far away
from yours; so you will still have the privilege
of keeping unearthly hours without disturbing
any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; that&#8217;s very considerate; but
I must be off. I want to get some papers
from my room, and then I must go to keep an
appointment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>&#8220;Of course! I shouldn&#8217;t know you if you
hadn&#8217;t an appointment. It wouldn&#8217;t be you.
Go on; but be prompt at dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may count upon me. And, by-the-way,
you&#8217;ll let me know whenever you&#8217;d like
me to do anything for your young friend&#8217;s
entertainment. I shall not be likely to know
the tastes and predilections of the Importation,
but if you think of anything I can do, I
am at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; but I let her look after herself
pretty much. I fancy there will be no
occasion to call on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw an amount of careless weariness
into her voice as she said this, that contrasted
strongly with the smile of unmixed amusement
with which she turned her eyes on Margaret
a moment afterward, as the footsteps outside
were heard ascending the staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;that&#8217;s Louis.
What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I possibly say?&#8221; said Margaret,
divided between amusement and indignation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>&#8220;Surely you must have some impression of
him,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a very pleasant voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t fail to notice that. I was
sure you would. New Englanders are somewhat
maligned in the matter of voices, I think.
That dreadful nasal twang, where it exists at
all among the more cultivated, usually belongs
to the women; though I must say Edward has
some relations, male and female, who set my
teeth on edge whenever they come near me.
But a really beautiful voice, such as Louis&#8217;, is
a rarity anywhere, and he pronounces his
words so exquisitely! Only to hear him say
&#8216;Matthew Arnold&#8217; rests every bone in one&#8217;s
body. I dare say you would have expected to
hear the endless succession of double o&#8217;s,
always attributed to <i>Noo</i> Englanders!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;I always supposed
cultivated New Englanders quite superior
to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They suppose themselves to be so, also,&#8221;
said Cousin Eugenia; &#8220;but they are not in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
cases, by any means. Edward himself had a
decided tendency in that direction when I
married him. I have often told him that what
first suggested to me to accept him was a curiosity
to see whether he would address me as
&#8216;Oogenia,&#8217; when he grew sentimental; and I
protest he did!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret could not help laughing at this,
but she soon became grave again, and said
seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I must be rather a <i>b&ecirc;te noir</i> to
Mr. Gaston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem so,&#8221; said Cousin Eugenia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will never call upon him to
escort me anywhere, or do anything whatever
for my entertainment,&#8221; Margaret continued.
&#8220;I wish you would promise me not
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart. I promise it as solemnly
and bindingly as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the footsteps were heard returning
down the stairs, and again they paused
outside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;Can you come and take this?&#8221; the pleasant
voice called softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door and hand it through a little
crack,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston answered.</p>

<p>The knob was turned from without, and the
door pushed open just wide enough to admit
the entrance of a neatly done-up parcel, held
in a large, finely formed hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston motioned to Margaret, who sat
just behind the door, to take the parcel, and,
not daring to protest, the girl moved forward
and received it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake hands, in token of pardon for my
slurs at the Importation,&#8221; the voice said, in a
tone of quiet amusement, and Margaret, obeying
another peremptory nod and glance from
Mrs. Gaston, transferred the parcel to her left
hand, and put her right one for a moment
into that of Louis Gaston.</p>

<p>&#8220;I perceive that the toilet is indeed in its
initial stages,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not a ring in place as
yet! I hardly seem to know your hand in its
present unfettered condition. I even think it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
seems slighter and colder than usual. The
Importation must have taken a good deal out
of you already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not choosing to have her hand imprisoned
longer in that firm and friendly clasp, Margaret
forcibly withdrew it and stepped back,
while Mrs. Gaston said, naturally:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease your invidious remarks and go to
your appointment, Louis. Thank you for the
candy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door was immediately closed from without,
and again the footsteps retreated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you&#8217;ve shaken hands with
Louis,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston said; &#8220;it&#8217;s an initiation
to a friendship between you, and, in the end,
you and Louis must be friends, though there
will be certain inevitable obstructions at first.
He is really the best and dearest creature that
ever lived. He had a dreadful illness once
from studying too hard for his college examinations,
and Edward and I nursed him through
it, and you don&#8217;t know how we did yearn over
that boy! He&#8217;s been devoted to me ever since,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
one proof of which is, that he always brings
me this candy from New York. Have some.
I&#8217;m sure he ought to be good to me,&#8221; she said,
critically peering into the box from which
Margaret had just helped herself, and selecting
a plump chocolate drop; &#8220;I certainly spoil
him sufficiently. Still, there isn&#8217;t very much
one can do for a man like that. He has such
frugal habits, it&#8217;s quite baffling. But tell me
what you think of him, after a second encounter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing more than I thought before,
except that he has a beautiful hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret, you are never disappointing,&#8221;
said Cousin Eugenia, warmly. &#8220;I felt sure
you would observe that. Go now and write
the letters that you spoke of while I dress,
and then we&#8217;ll go for a drive before lunch.
And, by-the-way, while I think of it, put on
your long black dress this evening, and wear
the black lace at the throat and hands, as you
had it the evening that the Kents were here.
Don&#8217;t wear any color, not even a bit of gold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
You know you gave me leave to make suggestions
when you came, and it&#8217;s the first time
I&#8217;ve used my privilege, though I think I am
usually rather fond of suggesting. Ring for
Lucy, please, and then hurry through your
letters, that we may have a nice long drive.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp;FEW minutes before six o&#8217;clock that evening,
Margaret, clad in a long black gown
that swathed her up to her milk-white throat,
came slowly down the broad staircase of General
Gaston&#8217;s house and entered the empty
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Finding herself alone, she moved across the
warm, bright room to the table which stood
under the chandelier, and taking up the evening
paper, which had just been brought in, she
began rather listlessly to run her eyes along
its columns. Presently some particular item
caught her attention, and so absorbed her that
she was unconscious of approaching footsteps,
until she caught sight of a gentleman who was
just entering the room from the hall.</p>

<p>Lowering the paper, she waited for him to
come forward, which he did with a certain perplexity
of expression and a slight confusion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
manner. Seeing these indications, the girl
looked into his face with frank self-possession,
and said gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Trevennon.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there was no immediate response, she
presently added:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Mr. Gaston?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of his own name recalled him,
and he came up and greeted her with a perfect
ease that instantly put to flight the moment&#8217;s
confusion; not however, before a watchful eye,
applied to a crack between the folding-doors of
the library, had noted the fact of its existence.
These doors were now suddenly thrown apart,
and Mrs. Gaston, dressed in a gay and ornate
costume, entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon of you both for not having
been on hand to introduce you,&#8221; she said, with
careless composure, as she took her brother-in-law&#8217;s
hand and turned her cheek to receive
his light kiss. &#8220;You have managed to dispense
with my offices, I&#8217;m glad to see! How are you,
Louis?&mdash;though it is the merest form to ask.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
He is one of the hopelessly healthy people,
Margaret, who are the most exasperating class
on earth to me. Anything in the <i>Star</i>, dear?
Let me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the paper from Miss Trevennon&#8217;s
hand, and began carelessly looking it over.
Suddenly her eye lighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something that may interest you,
Louis,&#8221; she said, handing him the paper, as
she pointed with her heavily jewelled finger to
a paragraph headed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Southern Imports.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same instant General Gaston entered
the room, and just afterward a servant announced
dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston had mentioned that it was characteristic
of her to be a magnanimous victor,
and it may have been that fact which prompted
her great urbanity to her brother-in-law on the
present occasion. She ran her hand through
his arm affectionately, as she walked toward
the dining-room beside him, and thanked him
with great effusiveness for the delicious candy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
To all which he answered by the not very
relevant response, uttered half under his
breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, madam! I&#8217;ll settle with you
for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret, of course, was <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> to Louis
Gaston at the table, and while both joined in
the general conversation which ensued, she
perceived, by her quick glances, that he was a
man of not more than medium height, with a
straight and well-carried figure and a dark-skinned,
intelligent face. He had dark eyes,
which were at once keen and thoughtful, and
very white teeth under his brown mustache.
Although in undoubted possession of these
good points, she did not set him down as a
handsome man, though his natural advantages
were enhanced by the fact that he was dressed
with the most scrupulous neatness in every detail,
the very cut of his short dark hair, parted
straight in the middle, and brushed smoothly
down on top of his noticeably fine head, and
the well-kept appearance of his rather long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
finger-nails, giving evidence of the fact that
his toilet was performed with punctilious care.</p>

<p>It was something very new, and at the same
time very pleasant to Margaret, to observe
these little points in a person whose first and
strongest impression upon her had been that
of genuine manliness. In Bassett, the young
men allowed their hair to grow rather long and
uneven; and when, for some great occasion,
they would pay a visit to the barber, the shorn
and cropped appearance they presented afterward
was so transforming as to make it necessary
for their friends to look twice to be sure
of their identity. As to their nails, in many
instances these were kept in check by means
of certain implements provided by nature for
purposes of ruthless demolition, and when this
was not the case they were left to work their
own destruction, or else hurriedly disposed of
in the intervals of vehement stick-whittling.
Not a man of them but would have set it down
as effeminate to manifest the scrupulous care in
dress which was observable in Louis Gaston,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and it was upon this very point that Margaret
was reflecting when Gaston&#8217;s voice recalled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m uncommonly glad to get home, Eugenia,&#8221;
he said, tasting his wine, as the servant
was removing his soup-plate. &#8220;I think Ames
is beginning to find out that this Washington
office is a mere subterfuge of mine, and that
the real obstacle to my settling down in New
York is my fondness for the domestic circle. I
really wish Edward could manage to get sent
to Governor&#8217;s Island. I must confess I should
prefer New York as a residence, if I could be
accompanied by my household gods and my
tribe. Shouldn&#8217;t you, Miss Trevennon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had been sitting quite silent for
some time, and Gaston, observing this, purposely
drew her into the conversation, a thing
his sister-in-law would never have done, for the
reason that she had observed that her young
cousin possessed the not very common charm
of listening and looking on with a perfect
grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been to New York,&#8221; said Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
in answer to this direct appeal, &#8220;and I
have only a limited idea of its advantages as a
place of residence, though I don&#8217;t doubt they
are very great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are, indeed,&#8221; said Louis, observing
her with a furtive scrutiny across the graceful
mass of bloom and leafage in the <i>&eacute;pergne</i>.
&#8220;You will like it immensely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I ever make its acquaintance,&#8221; said Margaret,
smiling. &#8220;Washington seemed to me
the border-land of the Antipodes before I came
here, and I have never thought of going beyond
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have lived, then, altogether in the
South?&#8221; said Gaston, with a tinge of incredulity
in his voice, so faint as to escape Margaret,
but perfectly evident to Mrs. Gaston, for the
reason, perhaps, that she was listening for
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, altogether,&#8221; Margaret answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor little cousin is in a most benighted
condition,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston said. &#8220;She has
not only never been to New York, but&mdash;only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
think!&mdash;until to-day she never heard of Ames
&amp; Gaston!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible! Unbelievable!&#8221; said Louis.
&#8220;Was it for this that they designed &#8216;All Saints,&#8217;
and have even been mentioned in connection
with the new skating-rink? Eugenia, you are
a true friend. It will not be necessary for me
to carry a slave about with me to remind me
that I am a man, like the great monarch we
read of in history; a sister-in-law is a capital
substitute and performs her office quite as
faithfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is well for me,&#8221; said Margaret,
smiling demurely, &#8220;that I began my list of ignorances
with such an imposing one; it will
make those that follow seem trivial by comparison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is wisdom in what you say, Miss
Trevennon,&#8221; said Louis; &#8220;and if you wish to
impress yourself with the magnitude of the
present one, get Eugenia to take you to see
&#8216;All Saints.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation now turned into other channels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and it was not until Margaret was saying
good-night to Mrs. Gaston, in the latter&#8217;s dressing-room,
that she reverted to this subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe that Mr. Gaston is a
clever architect,&#8221; she said, &#8220;his eye is so keen
and steady. I should like to see some of his
work. This &#8216;All Saints&#8217; Church is very beautiful,
I suppose. Shall we really go to see it
some day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston broke into her little light laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a piece of nonsense of Louis&#8217;, my
dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cheap little mission
chapel, built by a very poor congregation in a
wretched part of the town. The Travers girls
got Louis interested in it, and he made them
the designs and estimates and superintends its
erection. Of course he charged them nothing;
in fact, I believe he subscribed a good deal
toward it himself. He is amused at the idea
of their calling it &#8216;All Saints,&#8217; and making it
such a comprehensive memorial. He and his
partner have designed some really beautiful
buildings here, however, which I will show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
you. Louis is very clever, don&#8217;t you think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly feel able to judge, yet,&#8221; said Margaret,
&#8220;but if you say so, I will believe it, for
since I&#8217;ve been with you, Cousin Eugenia, I
begin to think I never knew any one before
who was clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you always forcing one to remind
you of your ignorance, child?&#8221; retorted Mrs.
Gaston, laughing lightly. &#8220;This is the most
convincing proof we have had of it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Margaret went up to say good-night, she
felt a strong impulse to express some of the
ever-ready affection which her cousin&#8217;s kindness
had awakened in her heart; but Cousin
Eugenia was a woman to whom it was very
hard to be affectionate, and she thwarted her
young cousin&#8217;s intention now by turning her
cheek so coolly that the ardent words died on
the girl&#8217;s lips. Mrs. Gaston was naturally unsympathetic,
and it almost seemed as if she
cultivated the quality. However that might
be, it was certain that, at the end of a month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
spent in daily companionship with this bright
and agreeable cousin, Margaret was obliged to
admit to herself that she had not taken one step
toward the intimate friendship she would have
liked to establish between them. Her cousin
was kindness itself, and always companionable
and agreeable, but she was scarcely ever really
serious, although she had at hand a reserve of
decorous gravity which she could always draw
upon when occasion required.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;EUGENIA,&#8221; said Louis Gaston, tapping
at his sister-in-law&#8217;s door one morning,
&#8220;I stopped to say that I will get tickets for
Miss Trevennon and yourself for the opera
Monday evening, if you say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t say so, my dear Louis, I assure
you,&#8221; returned Mrs. Gaston opening her door
and appearing before him in a tasteful morning
toilet. &#8220;If you take Margaret and me to the
opera, it must be for your own pleasure; she
is not the kind of guest to hang heavily on her
hostess&#8217; hands. I&#8217;ve never been at a loss for
her entertainment for a moment since she has
been here, and what is more, scarcely ever for
my own. I find myself quite equal to the task
of providing for her amusement, and so it has
not been difficult for me to keep my promise of
not calling upon you in her behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly never made me any such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
promise as that, and it would have been very
absurd if you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, perhaps then it was to Margaret that
I made it! The main point is that I&#8217;ve kept
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Eugenia, it goes without saying,
that when you have a young guest in the house
my services are at your disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly. Only, in this instance, I
prefer to let all suggestions come from yourself.
I know you only put up with my Southern relatives
because of your regard for me, and,
strong as is my faith in that sentiment, I don&#8217;t
want to test it too severely; but I won&#8217;t detain you.
Mrs. Gaston and Miss Trevennon
accept with pleasure Mr. Gaston&#8217;s kind invitation
for Monday evening. The opera is
<i>Favorita</i>&mdash;isn&#8217;t it? Margaret has never heard
it, I know; it will be very nice to initiate her.
Will you be at home to dinner to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; replied the young man,
looking back over his shoulder as he walked
away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221; soliloquized his sister-in-law,
as she turned back into her apartment.
&#8220;Quite as if you were never known to do otherwise!
Oh, the men! How facile they are!
Louis, as well as the rest! I had expected
something to come of this case of propinquity,
but I did <i>not</i> expect it to come so quickly. He
hasn&#8217;t dined out more than twice since she&#8217;s
been here, and then with visible reluctance,
and he has only been once to New York, and I
suspect the designs are suffering. And Margaret
too! It&#8217;s quite the same with her&mdash;saying
to me last night that his manners are so
fine that she is constrained to admit that, taking
Louis as an exponent of the Northern system,
it must be better than the one she had
always supposed to be the best! It works
rapidly both ways, but there must be a hitch
before long, for in reality they are as far asunder
as the poles. Every tradition and every
prejudice of each is diametrically opposed to
the other. How <i>will</i> it end, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened that Mrs. Gaston did an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
amount of shopping and visiting that day, and
was so fatigued in consequence that she had
dinner served to her in her own apartment, and
Margaret dined alone with the two gentlemen.
Afterward she went up and spent an hour
with the vivacious invalid, whom she found lying
on the bed, surrounded by an array of paper
novels by miscellaneous authors, the titles of
which were of such a flashy and trashy order
that Margaret felt sure she would never have
cared to turn the first page of any of them, and
wondered much that her intelligent and cultivated
cousin could find the least interest in
their contents. Mrs. Gaston was in the habit
of ridiculing these novels herself, but would
say, with a laugh, that they were &#8220;the greatest
rest to her,&#8221; and Margaret was continually expecting
to find her immersed in some abstruse
work, which would sufficiently tax her mental
powers to account for the liberal allowance of
relaxation which was to counteract it; but, so
far, she had been disappointed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston laid her novel by on Margaret&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
entrance, and gave her young cousin a cordial
welcome. The two sat talking busily until General
Gaston came up to his dressing-room to prepare
for a lecture to which he was going, and to
which he offered to take Margaret. His wife
put her veto on that plan, however, pronouncing
it a stupid affair, and saying that Margaret
would be better entertained at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are not to stay up here with me,
my dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Go down stairs. Some
one will be coming in by-and-by, I dare say,
and you must not think of coming back to
entertain me. I am bent on seeing how this
absurd story ends; it&#8217;s the most deliciously
preposterous thing I ever read,&mdash;so bad, that
it&#8217;s good! Say good-night now, dear. I know
you are never dull; so I dismiss you to your
own devices. I don&#8217;t know where Louis is,
but he may come and join you after a while.
There&#8217;s never much counting on him, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Margaret descended to the drawing-room,
the library doors were thrown apart, and
through them she could see Louis Gaston bending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
over some large sheets of heavy paper, on
which he was drawing lines by careful measurement.
He looked up at the sound of her footsteps,
and, as she took a magazine from the
table, and seated herself in a large chair before
the fire, he came in with his pencil in his hand,
and leaning his back against the end of the
mantel, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eugenia tells me you have never seen
<i>Favorita</i>, and I so rejoiced to put an end to
that state of affairs! You don&#8217;t know what an
absolute refreshment it has been to me to
observe your enjoyment of the music you have
heard since you have been here. I don&#8217;t think
I have ever received from any one such an impression
of a true appreciation of music. It
seems rather odd, as you neither play nor sing
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It pleases me to think that my own incapacity
does not interfere in the least with
my enjoyment of music,&#8221; Margaret said.
&#8220;When I hear beautiful music my pleasure in
it is not impaired by any feeling of regret that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
I cannot produce such a thing myself. It no
more occurs to me to long for that, than to
long to create a beautiful sunset when I see
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that one is attainable, while the
other is not, would make a difference, I think.&#8221;
He paused a moment, and then went on with
his pleasant smile: &#8220;Do you know this discovery
of mine&mdash;that of your fastidious appreciation
of music&mdash;has been the thing that
deterred me from inflicting any of my own upon
you? I was so set against this that I made
Eugenia promise not to acquaint you with the
fact that I can sing a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you do that?&#8221; exclaimed Margaret,
reproachfully, with a keen conception of
what lovely effects in singing might be produced
by this richly modulated voice, whose
spoken utterances she so admired. &#8220;I might
have had such delight in hearing you sing! I
am accustomed to having music so constantly
at home. We have a friend there, a young
man, who is almost like one of our own household,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
who sings beautifully. He has a lovely
voice, so pure and strong, but entirely uncultivated.
In some things it shows this almost
painfully, but there are others that he renders
exquisitely. Sacred music he sings best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that I have never tried, at least not
much. Your friend&#8217;s voice is the opposite of
mine. I had really very little to begin with,
and an immense deal of practice and training
has not enabled me to do much more than direct
properly the small amount of power I possess,
and disguise its insufficiency more or less. It
isn&#8217;t very much, after all, and yet how I have
pegged away at my scales and exercises! I had
a most exacting master when I was in Germany,
and as I was studying my profession at
the same time, I wore myself almost to a skeleton.
I studied very hard at the School of
Architecture, but I never practised less than
three hours a day&mdash;often four.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was talking on, very lightly, but he
stopped short, arrested by an expression on
the face of his companion that he was at a loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to account for. There was a look of enthusiastic
ardor in her eyes that amounted to positive
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you speak so lightly of a thing
that was really so noble?&#8221; she said, in a voice
full of feeling.</p>

<p>Louis&#8217; face broke into a smile of sheerest
astonishment, but at the same time he felt
himself strangely stirred by the feeling that he
had roused this warm admiration in the breast
of this fair young lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Trevennon,&#8221; he said earnestly,
&#8220;you amaze me by applying such a
word to my conduct. I went abroad to study
architecture and music, and there was every
reason why I should make the most of the
three years I had allotted to these purposes.
That I did my part with some degree of thoroughness
was only what I felt bound to do, in
the simplest justice to myself and others.
When I think of the fellows who accomplished
twice what I did, contending against such obstacles
as poverty, or ill-health, or the absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of proper facilities, I find the word <i>noble</i>, as
applied to myself, almost humiliating. Do
you know, your views on some points are extremely
puzzling to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at sea,&#8221; said Margaret gently, with a
hesitating little smile. &#8220;Things that I see
about me seem strange and unfamiliar, and I
often feel that I have lost my bearings. But
your resolute application to studies that must
often have been wearying and laborious, to the
exclusion of the relaxations most young men
find necessary, rouses my profound admiration.
I have never known a man who was capable of
a thing like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you do me the kindness to tell me if I
am blushing?&#8221; said Louis. &#8220;I veritably believe
so, and as it is a thing I have never been
known to do before, I should like to have the
occurrence certified to. I venture to hope,
however, that the fact is accounted for by my
being physically thick skinned, and not morally
so, for I have known myself to be blushing
when the fact would not have been suspected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
by outsiders. Just now, however, I fancy it
must have been evident to the most casual
observer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that the levity of his words and
tones were, for some reason, discordant to Miss
Trevennon, and so he spoke in a graver voice,
as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel musical to-night, and almost as if I
could overcome the hesitation I have spoken
of sufficiently to sing you some of the music
of <i>Favorita</i> in anticipation of Monday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you? It would be so delightful!&#8221;
exclaimed Margaret, fired at the
suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never feel that I can sing well when I
have to play my own accompaniments,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But for that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you have the music, do let me play
for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you do it? I thought you did not
play. Have you also been practising concealment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My music amounts to nothing, but I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
easily manage an accompaniment. Have you
the notes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just at hand. What a delightful idea!
I never thought of this. You shouldn&#8217;t have
cheated me out of such a pleasure all this
time. Let me open the piano. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tossed his pencil down upon the table,
and moved across the room as he spoke. Seeing
his action, Margaret checked herself as
she was following, and said suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot your work. I really cannot interfere
with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the work. The work may go.
I&#8217;ll make it up somehow. Could you manage
this, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>By way of answer, Margaret seated herself
and ran over the prelude with tolerable ease,
and at the proper time nodded to him to begin.</p>

<p>There was no interruption until the really
impressive voice had died away in the last
note, and then Margaret dropped her hands on
her lap and said, with a long-drawn breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see no lack. It is most beautiful. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
think you must have greatly under-estimated
your voice. It has a quality that touches me
deeply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What there is of it does pretty well,&#8221; Louis
answered, smiling, well pleased at her earnest
commendation. &#8220;Ames says I&#8217;m the best
singer to have no voice that he ever heard,
which is the greatest amount of praise I can
lay claim to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel more than ever, now, the lack of cultivation
in Mr. Somers&#8217; voice,&#8221; said Margaret.
&#8220;It is really a grand organ, but he scarcely
knows how to sing anything with entire correctness,
unless it is something in which he has
been carefully drilled by some one who knows a
little more than himself. I wish he could hear
you sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could hear him,&#8221; said Louis. &#8220;If
he has the voice, the cultivation can be acquired
readily enough; but with me the utmost
has been done. Much of this music is rather
beyond me. Let us try a ballad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was bending over the rack, in search of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
some particular piece, when the door-bell
sounded. They both heard it, and their eyes
met with a look of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Margaret, regretfully.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be interrupted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Louis, promptly, arresting
the servant on his way to the door by a
quick motion of the hand, &#8220;suppose you allow
me to have the ladies excused.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret assented readily, and the order
was accordingly given.</p>

<p>A moment later the servant came into the
room, presenting two cards on a tray. Gaston
glanced at them, and Margaret saw his face
change slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid Eugenia will make me suffer
for this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of these visitors was
young Leary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Margaret, simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely know who the Learys are?&#8221;
Gaston replied, in a tone of reproachful incredulity
that was almost severe. &#8220;They come
of one of the most distinguished families at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
North, and are here for the winter. The father
of this young man has held various important
diplomatic and political offices. They visit very
little, and Eugenia will be annoyed that young
Leary has not been admitted. I don&#8217;t think
he has ever called here before, except to
acknowledge an invitation. He sat near us at
the theatre the other night, and I saw that he
observed you; so this visit is probably a tribute
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you have said anything
about him to make me regret him especially,&#8221;
said Margaret, &#8220;only that he&#8217;s Mr. Leary; and
what&#8217;s in a name? Is there any reason why
one should particularly desire him as an acquaintance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston looked slightly bewildered.
Then he began to speak, and checked himself
suddenly. Then, turning back to the piano,
and beginning to look over the music, he said,
somewhat hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only that they are people it&#8217;s well to
be civil to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>There was something in the tone Louis took,
in regard to this matter, that puzzled Margaret&mdash;a
tone that had also puzzled her in the other
members of the Gaston family. There seemed
to be a certain anxiety with all of them to
know the right people, and be seen at the
proper houses, and have only the best people
at their own. Margaret Trevennon, for her
part, had never had a qualm of this sort in her
life, and supposed, moreover, that only vulgar
or uncertainly posed people could possibly be
subject to them. And yet here were people
who were not only not vulgar but more elegant
and charming than any men and women she
had ever known, who were entitled to, and
actually held, an unimpeachable social position,
and who yet seemed to find it necessary
to struggle hard to maintain it, and were continually
possessed by a positive anxiety to
appear to be distinguished! Really, it seemed
their first and principal concern. This was
the first time she had seen a decided indication
of the feeling in Louis Gaston, and somehow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
it hurt her more in him than in the others.
Unconsciously she gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;what
an unpleasant idea! Why need people assume
anything, when they actually have it all? It
never occurred to me that really nice people
could give themselves any concern of this sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, as she turned and suddenly met
Louis&#8217; eyes, her face broke into a smile of sudden
amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said the young man, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was laughing at some lines from the
&#8216;Bab Ballads&#8217; that happened to come into my
head just then,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were they? I dote upon the Babs.
Do let&#8217;s have them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Lord Lardy would smile and observe,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;How strange are the customs of France!&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Margaret. &#8220;I dare say they don&#8217;t
seem very relevant. But come, let&#8217;s go on
with the music,&#8221; she added, hurriedly. &#8220;We
must not prolong the interruption.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>Mr. Gaston had smiled at her quotation and
then become suddenly grave. As he selected
a sheet of music and put it on the rack before
her, he said seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;I sometimes see that there are little points
that we look at very differently. Perhaps we
may come to understand each other by-and-by.
I hope so, sincerely. And now, are you familiar
with this, and do you care for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The selection happened to be a favorite of
Margaret&#8217;s, and she entered delightedly into
its rendition, and very soon the lovely strains
of the sweet, sympathetic voice had banished
all discordant thoughts and memories.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Miss Trevennon,&#8221; he said, as the
song came to an end, &#8220;you&#8217;ve heard me do my
little best now. Your accompaniments suit
me perfectly. I am sure I never sang better.
I hope we may have many another pleasant
evening, such as this, together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had risen from the piano and was
standing before the fire, and she watched him
with mingled interest and surprise, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
neatly replaced the music in the rack, lowered
the instrument, and carefully arranged the
cover, with a habit of orderliness of which she
had also seen indications in General Gaston.
It was to her almost a new trait, in men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Eugenia insists upon early hours,
now that I am not going out,&#8221; said Margaret,
&#8220;so, as it is half-past ten, I will say good-night.
I feel rather guilty,&#8221; she added, pausing
in the door-way, &#8220;for interrupting your
work to-night. I dare say you wanted to finish
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as to that, it isn&#8217;t a matter of choice,&#8221;
he murmured; &#8220;Ames must have those estimates
to-morrow, and they are bound to go on
the morning train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when are they to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, at once. I can easily finish them off
to-night,&#8221; he replied carelessly. &#8220;Pray don&#8217;t
look as if you had committed a mortal sin, Miss
Trevennon,&#8221; he added, smiling. &#8220;I assure you
I don&#8217;t weigh this little nocturnal application
as dust in the balance against the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
I&#8217;ve had in this musical evening with you. I
hope it is not on my account you are hurrying
off. I assure you there is abundance of time
for my purposes. I shall take these papers to
my room and finish them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Margaret, bent upon not hindering him
further, retired at once.</p>

<p>The next morning Mrs. Gaston asked her
brother-in-law at breakfast, whether he had
not passed her room about sunrise, and, with
some confusion, he was compelled to own that
he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;What provoking ears you have, Eugenia!&#8221;
he said; &#8220;I flattered myself that a mouse could
not have been more noiseless. I am sorry to
have disturbed you, especially as you had not
been feeling well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was awake, at any rate. But what
was the occasion of your early expedition?&#8221;
she asked, without showing any especial surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to post some papers to Ames,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;and though I had told Thomas I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
ring for him to take them, the morning was so
bright and clear that I fancied I should like
the walk. And really it was most refreshing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can fancy you needed refreshment,&#8221; Mrs.
Gaston said, &#8220;if, as I don&#8217;t doubt, you had
been at work all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston made no response. He was
helping himself from a dish offered by a servant
at the moment, and seemed disposed to
let the matter drop; but Margaret, urged by an
irresistible impulse, arrested his eye and said
quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had I what, Miss Trevennon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you been at work all night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty much, I believe; but why do you
look so tragic? I am not in delicate health,
that the lack of a little sleep should entail
serious consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pleasure the way you like it&#8217;!&#8221; said Mrs.
Gaston. &#8220;Louis really likes that sort of thing;
he deserves no credit for it. I used to apprehend
that I should find myself brother-in-law-less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
very shortly in consequence of those
habits, but he thrives on them; he&#8217;s the healthiest
person I know. Don&#8217;t waste your sympathy
on him, Margaret; keep it all for me. It
isn&#8217;t those who endure hardships, but those
who can&#8217;t endure them that should be pitied.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE season was now fairly opened, and Mrs.
Gaston kept her young guest liberally
supplied with amusement. There were all
sorts of entertainments for them to go to, some
of which Margaret found very inspiring and
delightful, and some extremely dull. Cousin
Eugenia, however, found nothing unprofitable.
Every visit and every entertainment served
some purpose, in her abstruse economy, and, if
she failed to derive actual diversion from any,
it still fulfilled some end, and in some manner
was turned to account.</p>

<p>She would take Margaret with her on the
endless round of afternoon calls that she made,
never doubting that she was conferring an immense
favor on her young country cousin, until
the latter begged to be excused from some of
them, confessing that they wearied her. This
was a great surprise to Cousin Eugenia, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
cherished the honest conviction that every opportunity
of catching a glimpse of the great
world of fashion must perforce be esteemed a
high privilege and delight by this little Southern
cousin, whom she pitied profoundly for her
necessary isolation from such sources of happiness.
Margaret was perfectly aware of this,
and secretly much amused at it. That Cousin
Eugenia, or any one, should commiserate her
upon her lot in life was something very strange
to her, for she had always known herself to be
a very happy and fortunate girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kellers give such stupid parties!&#8221;
said Cousin Eugenia one evening, as she and
Margaret were returning from a large entertainment.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t missed one of them for
the past five years, and they are asphyxiating
affairs. I&#8217;m glad this one is well over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you go to them, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, every one does. At least every one
who can. You saw how full the rooms were
this evening, and yet every one there was
bored.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>&#8220;I was, undoubtedly,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;and
for that reason I should certainly not go
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can afford to be independent, my dear,
being here only on a visit, but if you lived in
Washington you&#8217;d soon find that it was desirable
for you to be seen at the Kellers&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, because of their position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret was silent a moment, and then she
said impulsively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do excuse my asking such a thing, Cousin
Eugenia, but I really want to understand.
Could it possibly enhance your social value to
be seen anywhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cousin Eugenia gave a little shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;You put things so oddly, child, with your
Southern notions! Of course our social position
is fixed and definite and nobody would
dispute it. But, large as the Kellers&#8217; circle is,
their parties are very <i>recherch&eacute;</i>, and it&#8217;s well
worth while to be seen there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Margaret.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>&#8220;Well, go on,&#8221; said her cousin, as the girl
hesitated. &#8220;Out with it. Let me hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only going to say that I thought a
lady, born and reared, never had to think of
anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where she is seen and whether her associations
will be considered correct. I thought
that it would all come of itself&mdash;that a lady
would not be in danger of making mistakes of
that sort, because what she did would be the
natural outgrowth of what she was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those may be the Southern ideas, but
you&#8217;d not find them to answer here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether they are Southern
ideas or not,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;I never knew
they were ideas at all. Certainly, I have never
heard them formulated before, and I don&#8217;t
quite know how to express myself. They simply
seem to me instincts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because of the associations you
have had,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston. &#8220;I have seen
very little of your parents of late years, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
they have lived in my mind as people of thorough
refinement. Your father is a model of a
gentleman&mdash;the most high-bred man I ever
knew, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>A radiant light came into Margaret&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling, dear old father!&#8221; she said,
fondly. &#8220;There is surely no one like him, and
yet if I were to repeat your compliment to him,
how amazed he would be! He has not an
idea how fine he is, and has never once
paused to consider whether he is high-bred or
not. He would not hurt the feelings of the
lowest wretch on earth&mdash;there is no one too
mean for his kindly consideration. May I tell
you an idea that has occurred to me, when I&#8217;ve
been in society here, surrounded by such well-dressed,
elegant looking, accomplished men,
and have compared them to him? It is that
they are all trying to be what he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston did not reply at once, but her
silence proceeded from no feeling of intolerance
of this sentiment. She was not at all given
to resenting things, partly because of a natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
indolence, and partly because she did not feel
enough on any subject to be biassed by impulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand your having that feeling
about your father,&#8221; she said, presently, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s quite possible it may be true. We will
submit the point when we find any one wise
enough to decide it for us. But the world
is large, and there are many men and many
minds, and manners vary in different places.
That line of tactics would not do in Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point in their conversation they
found themselves at home, and the subject was
consequently dropped.</p>

<p>It happened about this time that some of
Mrs. Gaston&#8217;s wide circle of Southern connections,
who were always cropping up in Washington,
came to the city, and Cousin Eugenia
took Margaret and went to call upon&mdash;or, as
she did not hesitate to put it, to inspect them.
They were a General and Mrs. Reardon, the
former an ex-Confederate officer, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
previously in the United States army, and who
was distantly related to both Mrs. Gaston and
Margaret, though neither of them had anything
more than a slight acquaintance with
him.</p>

<p>Margaret soon perceived that Cousin Eugenia
did not consider them up to the mark socially&mdash;a
fact which was further evidenced by their
being invited to lunch, and not to dinner, next
day. No one was asked to meet them, and
Mrs. Gaston excused the gentlemen on the
score of business hours. Margaret noted the
whole proceeding, and saw through it and beyond
it. Cousin Eugenia was perfectly polite
and pleasant&mdash;extremely sweet, in fact&mdash;and
yet there was something in her manner toward
these simple Southern people, of a type so
familiar to Margaret Trevennon, that the girl
involuntarily resented. She showed none of
this feeling to Mrs. Gaston, however, for she
was beginning to understand that, although
that clever lady in matters of abstract theory
appeared to be most reasonable and open to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
conviction, she was adamant itself in carrying
out her peculiar designs and purposes,
and quite unused to interference from any
one.</p>

<p>The Reardons came next day, according to
appointment, and the little luncheon-party
passed off very pleasantly, greatly owing to
Margaret&#8217;s efforts to make it do so.</p>

<p>When the guests were taking leave, they
asked if Mrs. Gaston and Margaret would not
go with them to an Art Exhibition in the evening.
The proposal came, in a subdued and
deprecating sort of way, from Mrs. Reardon,
who was still young and pretty enough to be
somewhat eager for pleasure, and although
Mrs. Gaston declined it for herself, on the
score of indisposition, she encouraged Margaret
to go, and the latter very willingly agreed
to do so.</p>

<p>She went accordingly, and was pretty well
entertained with what she saw, recognizing
some acquaintances, among whom was young
Mr. Leary, who had been sufficiently persevering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
to call again, with better success
next time, and who had always been especially
polite to Margaret on meeting her in society.
Shortly before leaving, an acquaintance of
General Reardon&#8217;s came up, to whom Margaret
was presented. He was a Major King, a
Southern man, as Margaret somehow divined
at a glance, and a resident of Washington, as
it soon appeared. Before the party separated,
he inquired where Miss Trevennon was staying,
and asked her permission to call upon
her. Margaret yielded the permission, of
course, but with a strange feeling of reluctance;
she saw that, though a familiar type of
Southern man, he was not a favorable one.
There was a sort of aggressive self-confidence
in his bearing, which was unpleasant enough
to her, but which she knew would be positively
offensive to the prejudiced minds of
the Gastons. He belonged to a class she knew
well&mdash;men whose range of vision had been
limited, but who were possessed of a feeling
of superiority to others in general, and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
absolute conviction of superiority to the best
Yankee that ever lived. It was an attitude of
mind that had always irritated her, but she
had never felt the force of it with such indignation
as now, when she was being hourly impressed
with the worth and superior qualities
of these people whom her Southern compatriots
regarded with such scorn. If Major
King should come to call, however, she could
feel confident that he would not betray the
presence of this vindictive feeling, for, despite
her disapproval of his tone and manner in
general, she felt that she could count upon
his possessing a spirit of courtesy, a hidden
germ of which she had rarely found wanting
in a Southern man&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>Margaret mentioned, at breakfast next morning,
the fact of her having met Major King,
and inquired of her friends if they knew him.
The two gentlemen were silent, and Mrs.
Gaston replied by a simple negative. She had
intended to mention the fact that he had proposed
to call upon her, but some instinct prevented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
her doing so. Very probably he would
not come; and, besides, she had an indefinable
feeling that there was danger in the
topic.</p>

<p>It had become a habit with Margaret to go
from the breakfast-table to the bow-window,
on the corner of the house, to watch for the
coming of the postman, and recently Mr. Gaston
had fallen into the way of accompanying
her. As the two young people found themselves
together in the richly curtained recess,
Margaret turned to her companion, with a
smile, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Leary was there last night. He talked
to me for quite half an hour. Ought I to
have been elated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; replied the young man,
frowning slightly. &#8220;Why do you ask such a
thing? The idea is quite absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Margaret, smiling.
&#8220;He has so little sense, and he talks so much
about himself. Here comes the postman!&#8221;
She broke off suddenly, running to open the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
door herself, never divining that it would have
been considered more decorous to wait until
Thomas came up from the lower regions, and,
with his usual deliberation, brought in the
letters on his silver tray.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT happened one evening, a few days later
on, that Margaret found herself once more
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Louis Gaston. General and Mrs.
Gaston had gone to a dinner, from which Margaret
was not sorry to be excused.</p>

<p>It was a cold and rainy evening in December,
and the drawing-room, with its rich drapery
and soft, deep Persian carpeting, was delightfully
comfortable and warm, the wind, as it
whistled and blustered outside, adding to this
effect. The bright lights which hung from
the ceiling, together with the glowing fire in
the grate, shed a perfect wealth of warmth and
radiance around, and brought out the delicious
fragrance of the fresh flowers, which filled a
china bowl on a distant table. Louis, as on
the former occasion, bent over the table, just
within the library door, with his back toward
the drawing-room, and Margaret, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
before, sat in the deep arm-chair before the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the lucky chance that I&#8217;ve been
waiting for,&#8221; said Gaston, turning to look at
Margaret, as she settled herself with her book.
&#8220;It is such a bad evening that I think we may
hope for an immunity from visitors, and in a few
minutes I shall lay by my work and come and
try some new music I&#8217;ve provided, if you agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be charmed,&#8221; said Margaret, with
ready acquiescence. &#8220;I feel just in the humor
for it. I utterly repel the proposition, however,
if you are going to sit up all night in
consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not, I assure you. It is not necessary,
in the least. I&#8217;ll just finish off a small
bit that I am engaged on at present, and then
put the rest by until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned to his work, and Margaret to
her reading, and for a few moments the silence
was unbroken, save by the sound of the wind
and rain outside, and the soft little noises
made by Louis with his pencil and rule.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>Suddenly the door-bell rang, and, as before,
they looked at each other regretfully. Louis
was about to make the same proposition that
his companion had responded to so promptly
on the former occasion, but a look at Margaret&#8217;s
face checked him. An instinct which she
scarcely understood herself, made it impossible
for her to do a thing like that now. The
fact that she was conscious of feeling a strong
liking for Louis, restrained her from giving
such a proof of it as this would be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to give up the music,&#8221; she said
simply, as Thomas went by to the door, unchallenged.
&#8220;There is still room to hope that
it is a call that will not concern us.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment this seemed likely, as there
was a short colloquy with Thomas at the door
before the visitor was admitted, and even after
that he lingered to remove his overcoat and
rubbers in the hall, with a deliberation that
implied a degree of familiarity that Margaret
could not identify as belonging to any visitor
at the house whom she had yet met.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>The next moment, as Louis Gaston and herself
were both watching the door-way, Major
King appeared, tall, gaunt, and awkward, but
eminently self-possessed.</p>

<p>His loosely hung, impractically tall figure
was clad in the inevitable shiny black &#8220;best
clothes,&#8221; that poor Margaret knew so well, even
to the cut of the long frock-coat, with its flapping
tails behind and its bagging, unhindered
fronts, between which was displayed, through
a premeditated opening in the vest, a modicum
of white shirt-front, interrupted for an inch
or so by the fastening of the upper buttons,
only to reveal itself in more generous expansiveness
higher up upon the Major&#8217;s manly
bosom.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s quick eye at once perceived the
incongruity of the whole situation, and warned
her of the necessity of effort on the part of
all to reconcile and overcome it. She went
forward and received Major King with the perfect
politeness which was as natural to her
as breathing, and then turned to present Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Gaston, who, with the folding-doors of the
library opened wide, was quite as if he were
in the same room.</p>

<p>Gaston&#8217;s aspect, at the first glance she gave
him, was absolutely startling to her. His
whole bearing had changed. He had risen
from his seat and turned toward the drawing-room,
and was standing by the table, very erect
and still. The expression of his face was repellant
to the last degree, the brows were contracted
in a slight but perceptible frown, and
the lips were shut with a firm severity.</p>

<p>Margaret, as she mechanically named the
two men to each other, could not help drawing
a swift mental contrast between the gaunt
Southerner, whose features were, in reality,
the handsomer of the two, and the Northern
man, in his quiet evening dress, and wondering
why the latter looked so greatly the superior.
Mr. Gaston&#8217;s attitude, despite its stiffness, was
dignified and impressive, and Major King&#8217;s,
notwithstanding its ease, was slouching and
ungainly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>But the most significant point of contrast
came when each man, after his kind, acknowledged
the introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, sir,&#8221; said Major King, in
loud, reverberating tones, and made a motion
forward, as if to extend his hand. This impulse
was repressed, however, by the short,
supercilious bow with which the other responded,
pronouncing the two words, &#8220;Good-evening,&#8221;
with a chilling and clear-cut utterance
that formed the strongest possible contrast
to the stranger&#8217;s bluff and off-hand style
of address. Margaret observed that he did
not pronounce Major King&#8217;s name at all.</p>

<p>The young girl watched this interchange of
greetings with a rush of conflicting emotions.
Indignation, shame, astonishment and real
pain fought for the predominance; but above
all, she was conscious of an instinct which
made her feel that the Southern man&#8217;s side
was her side.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston, as soon as the introduction was
over, resumed his seat at the library-table,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
and went on with his work, turning his back
squarely toward the drawing-room, an action
which made it impossible for Major King to
fail to realize that he was being intentionally
and deliberately slighted. How galling this
knowledge must be to a Southern man Margaret
well knew, and she felt all her sympathies
enlisted for Major King. With the keenest
anxiety she watched to see what his course
would be.</p>

<p>With a slight flushing of the cheek and a
dark flashing of the eye, the tall Southerner seated
himself in a delicate little gilt chair, which
he proceeded to tip backward, until his heavy
weight caused the slight wood-work to creak
ominously. Then, in response to a brilliant
leader respecting the weather, thrown out by
poor Margaret in her extremity, he launched
into a fluent and somewhat irrelevant strain
of conversation, which soon made it evident
that he could go alone. His voice, alas! was
loud and self-asserting, and his whole manner
so arrogant and ill-bred that Margaret felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
her spirit of partisanship growing fainter and
fainter. One thing alone was clear to her, and
that was her own course. She heard Major
King with polite attention, and answered his
remarks, when his fluency would permit, with
entire courtesy. But Margaret was on the
rack the whole time as he talked on, loud,
familiar, and irritating. Louis Gaston, seated
just within the library door, heard every word&mdash;as
indeed he must have been deaf not to do&mdash;and
Margaret fancied she could detect an expression
of angry superciliousness in the very
attitude of the well-set shoulders and the inclination
of the close-cropped head.</p>

<p>The minutes came and went, until they
mounted up to hours, and still Major King
sat and talked and laughed and told jokes with
a ghastly hilarity, which his companion found
it frightfully hard to respond to. Nine o&#8217;clock
struck&mdash;ten, eleven, and still he did not go! It
could not be that he was enjoying himself, for
the poor girl felt that he was secretly as uncomfortable
as herself, and, besides, he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
never have had a less entertaining companion.
She forced herself to attend, while he was giving
an account of a play he had seen the night
before, which must have been lame and impotent
enough in the first instance, but which
in the rehash was intolerable. She even
tried to laugh when he came to the amusing
parts, which he always indicated by laughing
loudly himself. But it was torture to her.</p>

<p>All things have an end, however, an indisputable
proposition with which Margaret had
buoyed herself up repeatedly during this trying
visit, and at last Major King rose to go. He
was not going to be browbeaten into a hasty
retreat, however. Not he! He would take
his time about it, and by way of a parting assertion
of ease, he took up a handsome book
from the table, and after reading the title
aloud, with a jocular air and a somewhat defective
pronunciation, he tossed it down so
carelessly that the beautiful <i>edition de luxe</i> fell
to the floor, with its delicate leaves crushed
open beneath its heavy cover. He made no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
effort to recover it, until he saw Margaret
stooping to do so, when he hastily picked it
up, and flung rather than placed it on the
table. When Margaret had shaken hands with
him, and said good-night, with no tinge of
abatement of the courtesy which had characterized
her conduct throughout, she looked
toward the library and saw that Mr. Gaston
had risen and turned toward them, bowing
to Major King with exactly the same motion
and expression as that with which he had
acknowledged their introduction. There was
one difference, however. The little frigid
bow was given in perfect silence, and not one
word of farewell was spoken. Major King responded
by a short, defiant nod, and a flashing
glance which might have surprised the other,
had he allowed his gaze to rest upon the visitor&#8217;s
face long enough to perceive it.</p>

<p>There was a necessary delay in the hall over
the rubbers and overcoat, which it seemed to
Margaret that he put on with elaborate slowness,
and then, at last, the front door closed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
behind Major King with a loud, contemptuous
bang.</p>

<p>The ordeal was over, but it left poor Margaret
with a heavy heart; she felt disgusted
with everything and everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a pin to choose between them,&#8221;
she was saying to herself, &#8220;only Mr. Gaston
was the host, and Mr. Gaston is the more enlightened
man, and therefore more bound to
know better.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was too angry to look at Louis, and was
leaving the room with a quiet &#8220;good-night,&#8221;
when the young man arrested her by saying, in
a tone of undisguised indignation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes past eleven o&#8217;clock; and a
first visit too! This is intolerable!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked straight into his eyes, with
a steady glance of scorn, that she made no
effort to disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say Major King was unaware of the
lateness of the hour,&#8221; she said, in a cool, high
tone. &#8220;Good-night, Mr. Gaston.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she walked quietly out of the room, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
mounted the stairs to her own apartment,
angrier than she had been yet.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her, turned the
gas on full, and stretched herself out at her
whole length on the lounge, clasping her hands
under her head. Her thoughts were too confused
to be formulated, but the one that predominated
over all the rest was that she could
never like Louis Gaston again. She had the
feeling that would have made her wish to fight
him had she been a man.</p>

<p>Major King&#8217;s conduct had been in the highest
degree reprehensible, but he had been led
on to it by the slights the other offered him.
And then, too, she had a keen perception of
what Major King&#8217;s opportunities had probably
been. He belonged to the class of impoverished
Southerners who had lost everything by the
war, and had probably spent most of the years
of his manhood in a small village, living in a
style that formed a strong contrast to the
affluence of his youth. His bearing, during
this trying evening, she attributed much to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
ignorance and much to the stinging sense of
failure and defeat, which the war had left on
so many Southern men. Added to all this,
there must have been a keen indignation at
the unjustness and insolence with which he
was treated by a man from whom he had a
right to expect common civility at least.</p>

<p>But with Louis Gaston it was different. He
could not plead the excuse of isolation and
ignorance. He was a cultivated man of the
world, who had all the advantages of education,
travel, and wealth; and, more than all,
his offence was heinous, in a Southern mind,
because it had been committed against the
stranger within the gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can ever wipe it out,&#8221; she muttered
to herself; &#8220;the longer one thinks of it
the worse it grows. There are half-a-dozen
palliations for Major King, but for Mr. Gaston
there is not one. I am certain that Major
King, in spite of it all, would have been incapable
of treating his worst enemy so. What a
mortifying, humiliating experience!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>And, with a gesture of disgust, Miss Trevennon
rose and walked to the dressing-table,
beginning slowly to unfasten her little ornaments,
in preparation for the night&#8217;s rest,
which, in her perturbed state of mind, was
very long in coming to her.</p>

<p>Louis Gaston, meanwhile, left to his own
reflections, grew conscious of the fact that he
was feeling very uncomfortable. The sensation
was not by any means a new one. He had
harbored it, uninterruptedly, for the past three
hours, but it had undergone a change in kind
and degree. He was relieved from the intolerable
infliction of Major King&#8217;s presence, but
unrest in another form had entered his breast;
and though its nature was less tangible and aggressive,
it somehow seemed to strike deeper.</p>

<p>He could not be blind to the fact that he
had offended Margaret, whose conduct during
the evening had really puzzled him as much
as his had puzzled her. How could she bear
to be pleasant and civil to a man like that? It
made him angry to think of the fellow&#8217;s daring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
even to speak to her, and he assured himself
that he had been perfectly right to pursue a
course which would free her from such an obnoxious
intrusion in future. And yet, under
it all, there was a glimmering, disturbing little
consciousness that he had somehow been in
the wrong. It was the first time in his life
that he had had occasion to distrust his social
methods, and he would not quite own to such
a state of mind now. There was, moreover,
another feeling at work within his breast,
which caused him to determine that he would
make some concessions, if necessary, to reinstate
himself in this young lady&#8217;s regard. It
was a thing which he knew he had heretofore
enjoyed, and he felt a strong reluctance to
giving it up.</p>

<p>Neither were Louis Gaston&#8217;s slumbers as
serene and tranquil as usual that night. He
made some effort to return to his work, but he
found it impossible to fix his attention on it,
and so retired to bed to wait for the sleep that
was so strangely long in coming.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Miss Trevennon appeared at breakfast,
the morning after Major King&#8217;s visit,
Mr. Gaston greeted her with more than his
usual cordiality, and for the first time addressed
her as &#8220;Miss Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young lady replied to his morning salutation
with a composed civility, and gave no
sign of having observed the distinguished
familiarity with which she was treated. She
was quite her usual self during the meal, but
she said little to Louis Gaston, and he observed
that she did not voluntarily look at him. By
the time that breakfast was ended she had
managed, without awakening the least suspicion
on the part of the others, to convey to
Louis Gaston the conviction that she was set
like steel against him.</p>

<p>It was at the same time depressing and inspiring
to the young man to perceive this. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
was sorry to have this charming girl angry
with him, and yet he could well imagine how
pleasant a reconciliation with her would be.
He was certainly not a coxcomb, but he was
accustomed to good-humored handling by
women, and he had no misgivings as to his
ability to adjust the present little difficulty to
his entire satisfaction. Meantime, there she
sat opposite, looking very charming, with her
air of dainty reserve. The impertinent little
ignoramus, to pretend to set <i>him</i> right! He
smiled to himself at the absurdity of the
thought. The situation seemed to him extremely
piquant.</p>

<p>He had already settled upon the remark with
which he would open the conversation, when
he should presently follow her into the bow-window
as usual, and he was therefore a little
disconcerted when Miss Trevennon passed out
of the dining-room by the door that opened
into the hall, and mounted the stairs to her own
room, whence she did not emerge until Louis,
after long waiting, had gone off down town.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>Later in the day, when Margaret found herself
alone with Mrs. Gaston, she had some
thought of informing the latter of last night&#8217;s
occurrences, but upon reflection this appeared
so difficult that she gave it up. It was doubtful
if any good purpose could be served thereby,
and besides it would be very hard to describe
her own feelings with sufficient reserve
to avoid the rudeness of speaking unwarrantably
to Mrs. Gaston of the brother-in-law who
was such a favorite with her. Apart from all
this, though there had been no opportunity for
the positive manifestation of the feeling, it was
borne in upon her that Mrs. Gaston herself
would be found ranged on Louis&#8217; side. So she
said nothing about the matter and listened to
Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s plans for the day just as
usual.</p>

<p>There was another dinner on hand for this
evening, and Mrs. Gaston expressed her intention
of going out to recuperate her energies by
a drive before luncheon, and Margaret presently
left her, agreeing to join her, ready for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the expedition, at twelve. In the hall she met
a servant with some letters, one of which
proved to be from her mother. This letter,
filled with all manner of little, familiar domestic
details, was read and re-read by Margaret
with a degree of feeling quite inconsistent
with the nature of its contents. The quiet
home-pictures presented such a contrast to
the annoyances recently encountered, that for
a while she heartily wished herself back at
Bassett.</p>

<p>There was but one item of especial importance
in the letter, and that was the announcement
of the sudden return from Europe of Mrs.
Trevennon&#8217;s nephew, Alan Decourcy, an individual
who had long reigned in Margaret&#8217;s
mind and memory as a veritable Prince Charming,
who possessed to the letter every endowment
of nature and advantage of fortune which
the most exacting of maidens could have asked.
Margaret had not seen him since he had come
to man&#8217;s estate, but, as a boy, he had spent
much of each year at a country home near Bassett,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
owned by his mother, and she had always
looked upon him as the most fortunate and
gifted of beings. He was an only son, and his
sister, who was some years older than himself,
was now married and living in Baltimore. To
this sister Margaret had pledged herself for a
visit before returning to the South. How
pleasant it would be to meet Alan there! His
mother was now dead, and after finishing his
course at a Northern university he had gone
abroad for a year&#8217;s travel, but it was only at
the end of four years that he had now returned.
She wondered if he would prove to be as handsome
and charming as memory painted him!
His occasional letters had been very delightful,
and led her to believe that all the bright
promises of his youth had been fulfilled. And
now he had actually returned, and she was to
see him! Mrs. Trevennon wrote that she had
already sent him her daughter&#8217;s address in
Washington, saying that he must run over
from Baltimore and see her. She added that
her nephew had said that he would probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
linger a while in New York before joining his
sister, and so his movements were rather indefinite.</p>

<p>The feelings which this announcement of
Alan Decourcy&#8217;s return awakened were contradictory.
Margaret was naturally very
anxious to see this charming cousin, but she
did not want him to come to see her in this
house; she hoped she might never have another
visitor here. Alan Decourcy was sure
to be all that was elegant and charming, but
since one person who had come to this house
to see her had been treated with such discourtesy
she wished for no more visitors. Already
she had begun to lay plans for the termination
of her visit, and she now resolved to
speak to Cousin Eugenia, on the subject of going
to Baltimore, as soon as the opportunity
should offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had Alan&#8217;s New York address,&#8221;
she said to herself; &#8220;I&#8217;d write and tell him I
would go to Baltimore, and so prevent his
coming here. What <i>would</i> papa and mamma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
think if they knew I was staying at a house
where I could not ask my cousin to call upon
me, because I had no assurance that my visitors
would not be treated rudely? They would not
believe it. They simply could not understand
it. My dear old father! He would take my
letter to the light and read it over with his
spectacles on, to see if there was not some mistake
in his understanding of it. Once convinced,
however, I know well enough what his
course would be. He would write me to come
away at once.&#8221; And Margaret rose to prepare
for her drive with eyes that had grown moist at
these recollections of her far-off home.</p>

<p>By the time that Cousin Eugenia sent to
summon her, however, Miss Trevennon had
recovered her composure, and when, a little
later, seated by her cousin&#8217;s side, she was
bowling swiftly over the smooth, hard pavements,
the exhilaration of the exercise had
roused her spirits to such buoyancy that small
annoyances, past and future, seemed trivial
enough to be ignored.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HAVING assisted, humbly and admiringly,
at Mrs. Gaston&#8217;s elaborate dinner-toilet
that evening, Margaret followed the gracefully
cloaked and hooded figure down the stairs and
out to the door-steps, when she said a gay
good-bye to her cousin and General Gaston, and
turned and entered the house. She had been
informed that Louis Gaston also had an engagement,
and so she had the not unwelcome
prospect of a quiet evening to herself. There
were some things that she wanted leisure to
think out, calmly and deliberately, and as the
drawing-room looked very warm and inviting
she turned toward it, and had sunk into her
favorite chair before the fire, when she perceived,
for the first time, that the library doors
were thrown open and that Louis Gaston was
sitting there at work. The sight was an irritating
one. His very attitude and the set of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
firm, strong shoulders, recalled vividly her discomfiture
of the previous evening, and roused
all the quick indignation she had felt then.
She was about to withdraw at once, in the
hope that he might not have perceived her
entrance, when he turned suddenly, and, seeing
her, rose and came forward, his face wearing
its pleasantest smile, and his manner at its
easiest and friendliest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cousin Margaret,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and so
they&#8217;ve left you behind! But I can assure you,
you needn&#8217;t regret it. The party is an old-fogy
affair, which will be long and tedious.
There&#8217;s some glory to be got out of it, I dare
say, but I&#8217;ll wager there isn&#8217;t much pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret heard him deliver himself of these
affable observations with intense indignation.
&#8220;Cousin Margaret&#8221; indeed! Did he presume
to suppose for an instant, that he could atone
for the indignity he had offered her, and the
positive pain he had caused her, by a few
careless words of flattery and a caressing tone
of voice?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have cared to go with them in
the least,&#8221; she answered coldly. &#8220;I am used
to quiet. Cousin Eugenia said you had an
engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have; but that can be postponed, as
also, I suppose, may be your meditations,&#8221;
answered Louis, feeling a keener zest in the
accomplishment of this reconciliation with
Margaret since he saw it was likely to cost him
some pains. &#8220;Suppose now you and I run off
to the theatre. There&#8217;s a pretty little play on
the boards, and we&#8217;ll take our chances for a
seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I don&#8217;t care to go out this evening,&#8221;
responded Margaret, in the same voice.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, which might
have lasted longer, but for some symptoms of
flight on the part of Miss Trevennon, which the
young man saw and determined to thwart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; he began, speaking with some
hesitation, &#8220;that I was so unfortunate as to
offend you in some way last night, when your
edifying visitor was here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t refer to that episode, unless
you mean to apologize for what you did,&#8221; Margaret
interrupted him, with an inflection of controlled
indignation. &#8220;Your laughing at him
now does not mend matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s whole expression changed.
This was really a little too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apologize!&#8221; he said quickly, a dark frown
gathering. &#8220;You are under some remarkable
delusion, Miss Trevennon, if you think I
acknowledge it to be a case for an apology. It
was a most presumptuous intrusion, and as
such I was compelled to resent it, on your
account as well as my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me be considered in the matter, I
beg,&#8221; said Margaret, with a little touch of
scorn. &#8220;I wish no such deed as that to be
done in my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask,&#8221; said Gaston, in a keen, distinct
voice, &#8220;whether your championship of this
gentleman is due to an admiration and endorsement
of his manner and conduct, or to the
more comprehensive fact of his being a Southerner?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
You Southerners are very clannish, I&#8217;ve
been told.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had always held herself to be
superior to sectional prejudices, but there was
something in his manner, as he said this, that
infuriated her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We Southerners,&#8221; she answered, feeling a
thrill of pride in identifying herself with the
race that, by his looks and tones, he was so
scornfully contemning, &#8220;are not only a clannish
people, but also a courteous one, and the
very last and least of our number is incapable
of forgetting the sacred law of hospitality to a
guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Miss Trevennon had forgotten
herself, but it was only for a moment. She
had said more than she meant to say, and she
checked herself with an effort, and added
hastily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I much prefer not to pursue this subject,
Mr. Gaston. We will drop it just here, if you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact that Mr. Gaston bowed calmly, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
quietly returned to his work, by no means
proved that he was in reality either calm or quiet.
It was only by a great effort of self-control that
he forced himself to be silent, for both the
words and tones that this young lady had used
were stingingly provoking. But what affected
him most was the stunning presumptuousness
of the whole thing. That this ignorant Southern
girl, who had passed most of her life in a
little insulated village, should venture to set
him right on a point which affected his bearing
as a man of the world, was infuriating. He
mentally assured himself that his conduct toward
the fellow, King, had been exactly what
it should have been, and, moreover, he determined
to take occasion to show Miss Trevennon
that he neither regretted nor desired to
apologize for it. He felt eager for an opportunity
to do this, and all his accustomed prejudices
and habits of mind grew deeper and
stronger.</p>

<p>For a few moments longer they kept their
places in perfect silence, Margaret in her seat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
before the fire and Gaston at the writing-table,
when suddenly the door-bell rang. Neither
moved nor spoke, and a few minutes later
Thomas announced a gentleman to see Miss
Trevennon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alan Decourcy!&#8221; exclaimed Margaret,
springing to her feet, in excited surprise, as
the gentleman approached. &#8220;Why, Alan, this
is unexpected!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Decourcy came nearer, and taking both
her hands in his, pressed them cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be ungrateful of me not to recognize
my cousin Margaret, in this tall young
lady,&#8221; he said, looking at her with obvious
admiration in his calm, gray eyes, &#8220;and yet
it is only by an effort that I can do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this instant Margaret remembered Louis,
whom, in the confusion of this meeting, she
had quite forgotten. She turned toward him,
naming the two men to each other, and to her
consternation she saw that he had risen, and
was standing erect, with exactly the same repellant
expression and attitude which he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
assumed in greeting Major King the evening
before. With the same frigid manner he acknowledged
the present introduction, and after
that little icy bow, he seated himself at his
writing and turned his back, as before.</p>

<p>Mr. Decourcy, meantime, had taken a chair,
from which Mr. Gaston&#8217;s attitude was perfectly
evident to him, but he showed quite as little
concern thereat as Major King had done.
And yet what a different thing was this form
of self-possession! Mr. Decourcy&#8217;s low-toned
sentences were uttered with a polished accent
that told, as plainly as all the words in the
dictionary could have done, that he was a man
of finished good-breeding. He treated Margaret
with an affectionate deference that she
could not fail to find extremely pleasing; inquired
for Mr. and Mrs. Trevennon, and said
he was determined to go down to see the old
home and friends before the winter was over;
told Margaret he was glad she had verified his
predictions by growing tall and straight; asked
if they still called her Daisy at home, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
whether it would be accounted presumptuous
for him to do so; said very little indeed of
himself and his travels, and at the end of about
fifteen minutes rose to take leave.</p>

<p>Margaret quietly replied to all his questions,
and when he held out his hand to say good-bye,
she made no motion to detain him, by
word or sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to Baltimore in a day or
two,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and shall hardly see you
again, but I hope you will allow me to arrange
for a visit from you to my sister, to take place
very soon. When she writes to you on the
subject, as she will do at once, do let her find
you willing to co-operate with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Margaret was uttering a hearty assent
to this plan, Louis Gaston, who had, of
course, heard all that had passed, was rapidly
casting about in his mind as to how he should
rescue himself from an odious position. There
was now no more time to deliberate. He
must act; and accordingly he came forward,
with a return to his usual manner, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Margaret had once thought so good, and said
frankly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to have an important bit of
work on hand, Mr. Decourcy, which it was
necessary for me to finish in haste. I have
been obliged, therefore, to forego the pleasure
of making your acquaintance, but I hope you
will give me your address that I may call
upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I am at the Arlington for a
day or two,&#8221; responded Decourcy, with his
polished politeness of tone and manner, in
which Margaret felt such a pride at the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite early,&#8221; Louis went on, &#8220;and my
brother and sister have deserted Miss Trevennon
for a dinner. Will you not remain and
spend the evening with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alan Decourcy possessed to perfection the
manner which George Eliot describes as &#8220;that
controlled self-consciousness which is the expensive
substitute for simplicity,&#8221; and it was
apparently with the most perfect naturalness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
that he pleaded another engagement and took
leave, with compliments and regards to General
and Mrs. Gaston. The price this young
man had paid for this manner was some years
of studious observance of what he considered
the best models at home and abroad, and his
efforts had been eminently successful. It imposed
upon Margaret completely, and charming
though she saw her cousin to be, she would
have said that his manners were as unstudied
as a child&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Louis Gaston, on his part, considered the
matter more understandingly. He recognized
in this cousin of Miss Trevennon a polished
man of the world. The type was familiar
enough to him, but he knew that this was an
exquisite specimen of it, and the very fineness
of Mr. Decourcy&#8217;s breeding made his own recent
bearing seem more monstrously at fault.
He felt very anxious to set himself right with
Miss Trevennon at once, but almost before he
had time to consider the means of doing this
she had said good-night and gone up stairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>He stood where she had left him, abstracted
and ill at ease. What a power this girl had
of making him feel uncomfortable; for it was
not Decourcy&#8217;s censure and disapprobation
that he deprecated half so much as Margaret&#8217;s.
Again there came into his breast that new,
strange feeling of self-distrust. He shook it
off with a sigh, tired of self-communing and
reflection, and anxious to act. He felt his
present position unendurable.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he rang for Thomas and sent
him to ask Miss Trevennon if he could speak
to her for a few minutes. Thomas carried
the message, and presently returned to say
that Miss Trevennon would come down.</p>

<p>When she entered the room, soon after, she
looked so stately, and met his eyes with such
a cold glance, that a less determined man
might have faltered. He was very much in
earnest, however, and so he said at once:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ventured to trouble you to return, Miss
Trevennon, in order that I might apologize to
you for what I acknowledge to have been an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
act of rudeness. I am exceedingly sorry for
it, and I ask your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have it, of course, Mr. Gaston. An
offence acknowledged and regretted is necessarily
forgiven. I want you to tell me explicitly,
however, what act you refer to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel myself to have acted unwarrantably,
indeed rudely, in my manner of receiving your
cousin. I was angry at the time, and I forgot
myself. I have done what little I could to
atone for it to Mr. Decourcy, but I felt that I
owed you an apology, because in acting thus
toward a guest of yours I was guilty of a
rudeness to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret was silent; but how she burned
to speak!</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I forgiven?&#8221; said Gaston, after a little
pause, for the first time smiling a little, and
speaking in the clear, sweet tones that she had
lately thought the pleasantest in the world.
If she thought so still, she denied it to her
own heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need hardly say, Mr. Gaston,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
answered, forcing back a sigh, &#8220;that as far as
I am concerned, you have quite atoned for
your treatment of my cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then am I reinstated in your favor, great
Queen Margaret, and will you give me your
royal hand upon it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He extended his hand, but Margaret quickly
clasped hers with its fellow, and dropped
them in front of her, while she slowly shook
her head. There was none of the bright
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> so natural to her, in this action; she
looked thoughtful and very grave.</p>

<p>The young man felt his pulses quicken; he
resolved that she should make friends with
him, cost what it might. It had become of the
very first importance to him that he should be
reinstated in that place in her regard which
he knew that he had once held, and which
he now felt to be so priceless a treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am still unforgiven, I see,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
you will at least tell me what is my offence
that I may seek to expiate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret raised her candid eyes to his and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
looked at him a moment with a strange expression;
doubt, disappointment and glimmering
hope were mingled in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I be frank with you?&#8221; she said,
speaking from a sudden impulse. &#8220;I should
like to, if I dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be distressed if you are not,&#8221; he
said, almost eagerly. &#8220;I beg you to say freely
what you have in your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not speak at once, but sank into a
chair, with a long-drawn respiration that might
mean either sadness or relief. When Gaston
had brought another chair and placed it close
beside her and seated himself, she looked up
and met his gaze. In the eyes of both there
was the eagerness of youth&mdash;in the girl&#8217;s a
hesitating wistfulness, in the man&#8217;s a subdued
fire, somewhat strange to them. He was conscious
of being deeply stirred, and if he had
spoken first his words would probably have
betrayed this, but it was Margaret who broke
the silence, in tones that were calm and steady,
and a little sad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>&#8220;Mr. Gaston,&#8221; she said, turning her eyes
away from his face and looking into the fire,
&#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be worth while, I think, for me to
pretend to feel the same toward you, after
what has happened; it would be only pretence.
Twenty-four hours ago I should have said you
were the young man of all my acquaintance
whom I felt to be the truest gentleman. I would
not say this to your face now, except that it
is quite passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that you have said it&mdash;most glad
that it was ever so,&#8221; he said, with a hurried
ardor; &#8220;but it is a great height to fall from.
And have I indeed fallen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Margaret, not smiling at all,
but speaking very gravely. &#8220;You began to
fall the moment Major King came into this
room last night, and you have been falling
ever since, as I have gone over it all in my
mind. You reached the bottom when my cousin
came in this evening, and the shock was so
great that it caused a slight rebound; but I
don&#8217;t suppose that signifies much.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>If the girl&#8217;s eyes had not been fixed upon
the fire she would probably have checked her
speech at the sight of the expression which
settled upon her companion&#8217;s face the moment
Major King&#8217;s name was mentioned. But she
did not see it, and was therefore unprepared
for the hard, cold tone in which his next words
were uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have felt and acknowledged my fault,
where your cousin was concerned,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Mr. Decourcy is a gentleman, and nothing
but the fact of my being preoccupied with the
resentment I felt at certain words of yours at
the time, would have caused me to act toward
him as I did. This explains, but does not justify
my conduct, which I have acknowledged
to be unjustifiable. But in the other case, Miss
Trevennon, I must maintain that I acted
rightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is your feeling about it,&#8221; Margaret
said, &#8220;I think this conversation had better
end here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Trevennon?&#8221; he asked, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
little defiantly. &#8220;I see no reason why it
should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because its object, as I suppose, has been
to bring about an understanding between us;
and since you have defined your sentiments, it
is clear to me that we could no more come to
understand each other than if you spoke Sanscrit
and I spoke French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you are mistaken,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have a feeling that our positions are not so
widely different as they may appear to be.
Don&#8217;t refuse to listen to me, Miss Trevennon;
that would be unjust, and you are not an unjust
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a wonderful proof of the hold she
had laid upon him that he took such trouble
to exonerate himself in her eyes, and he felt it
so himself, but he no longer denied the fact
that Miss Trevennon&#8217;s good opinion was a matter
of vast importance to him. The little impulses
of anger which her severe words now
and then called forth, were always short lived.
One glance at the lovely face and figure near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
him was generally enough to banish them,
and now, as he treated himself to a long look
at the fair countenance, with its sweet downcast
eyes and slightly saddened mouth, the impossibility
of quarrelling with this exquisite
creature presented itself so strongly, that he
grew suddenly so friendly and at ease, that he
was able to assume a tone that was pleasant,
and almost gay, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Trevennon, honor bright! You
know perfectly well that you don&#8217;t like that
man one bit better than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him at all. I yield that point
at once, but I fail to see how that affects the
matter. Children and savages regulate their
manners according to their tastes and fancies,
but I had always supposed that well-bred men
and women had a habit of good-breeding that
outside objects could not affect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman&#8217;s house is his castle, Miss
Trevennon,&#8221; said Gaston, with a return to his
former tone and manner; &#8220;and it is one of the
plainest and most sacred of his duties to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
that the ladies of his household are protected
from all improper contact. In my brother&#8217;s
absence I stood in the position of the gentleman
of the house, and I did right to adopt a
line of conduct which would save you from a
like intrusion in future. I owed it to you to
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Margaret, waving
her hand with a pretty little motion of scornful
rejection. &#8220;You allowed your consideration
for me to constrain you too far. I have
led a free, unrestricted life, and am accustomed
to contact with those who come and go. No
man has a finer feeling as to what is fitting for
the ladies of his family than my father, but
though I should live to reach old age, I shall
never see him pay so great a price for my immunity
from doubtful association as an act of
rudeness to any one whomsoever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, Miss Trevennon,&#8221;
said Gaston, speaking rather warmly, &#8220;if you
lived in Washington, you would see things
differently. There&#8217;s no end to the pushing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
impertinence of the people who hang about a
city&mdash;this one especially, and a gentleman does
not like to have his friends in danger of meeting
these obnoxious creatures at his house. It
looks very queer, and people think so, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a gentleman&#8217;s position, then, so easily
impeached? Now I should have thought that,
with your name and prestige, you might
weather a good many queer appearances. An
annoyance of this sort would not be likely to
happen often. That it is an annoyance, I do not
deny; but I think there must be a better way
of preventing such things than the one you
adopted. And oh, Mr. Gaston, while we are
on this subject, I wonder how you can ignore
one point, the agony that you caused me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>I</i> caused you, Miss Trevennon? It
is hard, indeed, to lay at my door the discomfiture
you endured last evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was the most wretched evening
I ever passed,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;and it was
only your conduct that made it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My conduct? Now you <i>are</i> unjust!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;I am not so
wholly uninured to the necessity of sometimes
hearing annoyances, as to be made miserable
by having to talk for several hours with a
man I do not like. You will never believe it,
of course, but I do not think Major King is a
man who lacks good feeling, the essence and
soul of politeness. He belongs to a type that
I know very well. He is an ignorant man and
a very self-opinionated one, and he has been
so long in need of association with his superiors
that he has begun to think that he has
none. He does not know the world, and is
therefore unaware of the fact, that a man who
holds the position of a gentleman may be
guilty of many lapses without losing that
position. I spoke just now of its being rather
a light tenure, but, in some ways, it is very
strong, it seems. I have said I do not like
Major King, but I believe it is a mistake to
call him vulgar. He is foolish and conceited,
because he has had very slender opportunities
to learn better. But oh, Mr. Gaston, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
different with you! It is impossible not to
draw the contrast. You know the world.
You have studied and travelled. You are
clever, cultivated and accomplished, and to
what end? It has all resulted in an act which
yesterday I would have wagered my right hand
you were incapable of.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with real feeling in her voice, and
Gaston caught this inflection, and the sound
of it quickened his blood. His ideas and
emotions were strangely confused. He felt
that he ought to be angry and resentful, but
he was conscious only of being contrite.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said too much. I have spoken far
too freely,&#8221; said Margaret, breaking in upon his
reflections. &#8220;I meant to be quite silent, but
when you urged me to speak I forgot myself.
I am sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be,&#8221; the young man answered gently;
&#8220;the fact that these are your opinions entitles
them at least to my respect. But there is one
thing I must mention before we drop this subject.
I cannot be satisfied to allow you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
retain the idea that I was accountable for the
discomfiture you endured yesterday evening.
You must know that I would joyfully shield
you from all vexations and annoyances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Margaret gently, shaking her
head; &#8220;it was you, and not Major King, who
made those hours so wretched to me. You
made no effort to conceal the fact that you
were outraged and indignant, and what could
be clearer than that I had been the means of
bringing this deeply resented annoyance upon
you? If you had thought of me, you must
have seen that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of you continually. It was
chiefly upon your account that I resented the
intrusion. It matters little to a man whom he
happens to rub against, but it pains me deeply
that a lady&mdash;that <i>you</i> should not be screened
from such intercourse.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of herself, Margaret was touched
by this. A hundred times, since she had
known him, she had seen Louis Gaston give
evidence of an exquisite feeling of deference to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
women, and she could readily believe that he
had been influenced on this occasion partly
by consideration for herself; and while she
resented the means used she did justice to the
motive.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is much better that we have talked of
this,&#8221; she said presently. &#8220;I do thank you
for having that feeling about me. You could
not know it was not needed. I will try to
forget it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not succeed,&#8221; he said; &#8220;your
tone convinces me of that. I wish we understood
each other better, Miss Trevennon, and
I do not yet give up the hope that in time
we may.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out his watch and looked at it, saying
in tones that showed him to be in a serious
mood:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an appointment to see a man on
business, and I must go and keep it. I shall
probably be late coming in, and shall hardly
see you again, so I&#8217;ll say good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he turned and went into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
hall, and a moment later Margaret heard the
front door close behind him.</p>

<p>As she slowly mounted the stairs to her
room, she remembered that he had not asked
her again to shake hands with him, in token
of a re-establishment of the old relationship
between them, and, on the whole, she did not
regret it. It was as well that he should know
that he was not restored to his former place
in her regard. Her faith in him had been
terribly shaken, and it seemed impossible he
could ever be to her again the man she had
once thought him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Mrs. Gaston and Miss Trevennon
were driving along the avenue next morning,
the former said abruptly, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me of your cousin&#8217;s visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t see you when you came in,
you know,&#8221; answered Margaret evasively.
&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Louis: and I gathered from certain indications
that there had been something unpleasant
in this meeting. I didn&#8217;t ask him to
explain it to me, and I don&#8217;t ask you. I hate
explanations. I have always foreseen that a
certain amount of clashing was inevitable between
you and Louis. You are both very well
in your ways, but your ways are very different
and not very reconcilable. I am very sorry
anything of the sort happened; but I don&#8217;t let
it prey upon my mind, and I hope you will not
either.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;it was nothing
very important. Mr. Gaston was rude to Alan
when he first came in, but he atoned for it as
far as he could afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a handsome drag containing
two gentlemen and a liveried servant was
seen approaching, and, as it came up to them,
one of the gentlemen recognized Margaret with
a bow and a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Alan now!&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;I
wonder who the gentleman is, who is driving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s young Lord Waring,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston,
with animation. &#8220;He is attached to the
British Legation&mdash;the minister&#8217;s nephew, I believe.
And so that was Alan Decourcy! What
a charming young man! I wonder how Louis
could be rude to a man like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Margaret&#8217;s usual habit to pass over
such remarks as this from Cousin Eugenia, as
she was convinced of the fruitlessness of argument
in her case; but this speech touched her
on such a sore point that she could not help
saying, in rather keen tones:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>&#8220;A man who could be rude to any one
whomsoever, must be somewhat difficult to
count upon, I should think. He must be often
puzzled to decide whom to treat civilly and
whom to snub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you go, with your high-flown
Southern notions,&#8221; retorted Mrs. Gaston, with
imperturbable good-humor. &#8220;You&#8217;re your father&#8217;s
own child! But we must have this elegant
young man to dinner. Do you happen to
know if he is engaged for this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear him
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will probably call during the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he will not,&#8221; said Margaret, decidedly.
&#8220;He told me he should not see me again before
going to Baltimore. But he is to make
arrangements for me to go over for a little visit
soon, and I shall see him then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! He&#8217;s to come and see you at
my house, and he&#8217;s to make friends with us all.
Louis has been in the wrong, and he shall be
made to see it. Leave that to me. I shall write<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
young Decourcy a note as soon as I get home;
and you shall write too, and endorse my invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret felt very anxious that her cousin
should come and dine at the Gastons&#8217;, but she
seriously doubted his willingness to do so.
Despite his perfect courtesy, there had been
something in his manner toward Louis Gaston
that made it clear that he did not desire to improve
the latter&#8217;s acquaintance, and she wanted
him to see that in the interview he had had
with Gaston he had seen Louis at his worst, and
to realize that he had a better side. And, on
the other hand, she wanted the Gastons to see
Alan Decourcy as a specimen of a Southern
gentleman, who not only possessed, by inheritance,
all the instincts and traditions that she
clung to and respected, but who, in addition
to these, had had sufficient contact with the
world to get rid of that colossal belief in himself
and his own methods and manners, as the
only commendable ones, which she felt to be
one of the chief failings of her countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
She had been too long accustomed to the arrogant
assumption that a Southern man had better
take the wrong way in any issue than learn
the right way from a Yankee, not to rejoice in
the prospect of presenting to her friends a
young Southerner who was really enlightened,
and who, if he loved his own land best, did so
because he had compared it with others, and
not because he was ignorant of everything beyond
it.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Gaston had despatched her
note, inviting Mr. Decourcy to dine with them
that evening at six, and there came a response
regretting that a previous engagement for
dinner prevented his accepting her invitation,
Mrs. Gaston was quite provoked about it,
and when they were at dinner she confided
her disappointment to her husband and his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I called on him at the Arlington, this
morning,&#8221; said Louis, &#8220;but he was out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we met him,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston. &#8220;He
was driving with Lord Waring.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>Margaret felt a little throb of gratification,
as her cousin made this announcement, of
which she was deeply ashamed the next instant.
&#8220;I am getting the most horrid ideas into my
head,&#8221; she said to herself; &#8220;what a little snob
I should have felt myself two months ago, to
be filled with vulgar elation at the thought of
Alan Decourcy being seen driving with a lord!
It&#8217;s perfectly humiliating!&#8221; But all the same,
the satisfaction remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where he is going to dine,&#8221; Mrs.
Gaston went on, presently. &#8220;He will call, of
course, in acknowledgment of my invitation,
and when he does, Margaret, you must ask
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning he did call, and Mrs. Gaston
and Margaret were at home to receive him.
Margaret asked him, in the course of their
talk, where he had dined the day before, and
convicted herself a second time of snobbishness
by the pleasure she felt in hearing him
answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;At the British Legation. The minister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
happens to be an old acquaintance, and Waring
and I were great chums at one time. By-the-way,
he was, for some reason, rather struck
with you, Daisy. He was with me when I
met you driving yesterday, you remember. I
told him you were a pet cousin of mine, and it
may have been on that account that he asked
me to bring him to call upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will do so,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston said.
&#8220;We should be glad to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no under-bred eagerness in her
tones as she said it, but Margaret suspected
that there might be a little in her heart, and
she was not sorry when Decourcy answered,
merely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; you&#8217;re very kind,&#8221; and then
changed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I picked up a little present for you, when
I was in Naples, Margaret. I unpacked it this
morning and will send it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes after this he took leave,
having made on both ladies an extremely good
impression, which Mrs. Gaston owned to, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
voluble phrases, and which Margaret concealed
under a very calm exterior.</p>

<p>A day or two later Alan called again, and
brought with him Lord Waring, who proved
to be a little dull. He was shy and constrained
in manner and hampered by a certain
gawkiness which Decourcy&#8217;s exquisite ease of
breeding made the more apparent. In spite of
all this, however, there was something rather
distinguished in the young foreigner, a sincerity
and simplicity that stamped him as a man of
worth, and a commanding self-security that was
as far removed from self-sufficiency as possible.</p>

<p>It was arranged between Miss Trevennon
and her cousin that they were to go to Baltimore
in a few days, and it was not until he
rose to take leave that he put into her hands
a box, which he told her contained the little
present he had spoken of.</p>

<p>As soon as the two gentlemen had gone,
Margaret tore open the parcel with the eagerness
of a girl to whom presents are somewhat
rare, and discovered, in a beautiful little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
mosaic box, an antique silver chatelaine of the
most rare and exquisite workmanship. There
was a small watch, and other richly chased
pendents, and the whole thing was pretty
enough to delight any girl alive, even in the
absence of a just appreciation of its value.
Cousin Eugenia, however, being thoroughly
initiated in all such matters, was handling and
examining it with a depth of appreciation that
almost brought tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Margaret, it is a superb present,&#8221; she
exclaimed; &#8220;a veritable antique, such as not
one woman in a thousand is lucky enough to
possess. You <i>must</i> let me show it to Mrs.
Norman; she is continually flaunting hers in
peoples&#8217; faces, and it doesn&#8217;t compare with this.
I should say it is quite modern beside this.
Just look at these clasps. The watch is not
so antique, but the chains and clasps are wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret, as she looked on and listened, could
scarcely conceal the amusement she felt. She
had often before this had reason to observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the almost solemn emotion with which Cousin
Eugenia was wont to regard certain articles of
great luxuriousness or magnificence. She had
seen her stirred to the soul by a plush <i>porti&egrave;re</i>,
and almost tearful at the mere recollection of
a French costume. Appreciation was one
thing, but this was another. It transcended
mere appreciation, and seemed, in some way,
to be tinctured with the heroic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an &aelig;sthete you would have made,
Cousin Eugenia, if only the proper influences
had been brought to bear!&#8221; said Margaret,
laughing. &#8220;I can fancy you speaking, in
awed and hushed accents, of a strange and
mysterious color, or a significant and subtle
bit of drapery. You consider yourself unemotional,
but you have depths which may be
stirred. It takes a silver chatelaine of a rare
order to compass it, however, or something as
imposing. I have to thank you for enlightening
me as to the value of Alan&#8217;s gift. If
I tell him you wept upon it, it may compensate
in some measure for my Philistinism.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>&#8220;He must have taken great care in the selection
of this present for you,&#8221; Mrs. Gaston
said. &#8220;He admires you very much, Margaret.
I begin to wonder what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret laughed gayly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means nothing whatever,&#8221; she said; &#8220;for
goodness&#8217; sake, don&#8217;t get up any absurd notion
about Alan Decourcy and me. It&#8217;s a brand-new
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you it may be&mdash;not to him. He has a
way of watching you that means something.
A careful, scrutinizing interest in all you do is
observable, and often it changes into those
quiet signs of approbation, which mean so
much in a man like that. I shall be prepared
for a prompt surrender, so don&#8217;t be afraid of
startling me if you have anything to communicate
from Baltimore. He told me the other
day, that he had reached an eminently marriageable
age, and was dreadfully afraid of passing
beyond it. He also said that he much preferred
to marry one of his own countrywomen;
and I believe that is what brings him home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>Margaret gave an amused attention to her
cousin&#8217;s speculations, after which they fell to
talking of the proposed visit to Baltimore,
which Cousin Eugenia acquiesced in only on
condition that it should be of but one week&#8217;s
duration, and that Margaret should return to
Washington for Christmas. This she agreed
to do, resolving, if she found it desirable, to
arrange for another visit before returning to
the South.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET had been, from the first, eager
to hear Decourcy&#8217;s criticism of the Gastons,
and when she found herself seated by her
cousin&#8217;s side, in the train on the way to Baltimore,
with the prospect of an hour&#8217;s <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
before her, she felt sure he would volunteer
his impressions. She only hoped that he would
remember that, in spite of all, she really liked
them, and that he would refrain from speaking
too resentfully on the subject. She was full of
unuttered criticism herself, but a feeling of
loyalty to the friends who had shown her so
much kindness deterred her from introducing
the topic. It soon appeared, however, that
Mr. Decourcy had no intention of speaking of
it at all. Of course they talked about the
Gastons, but it was only in incidental allusions,
and, after all, it was Margaret who invited his
criticism by saying directly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>&#8220;What do you think of them, Alan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty well,&#8221; he answered lightly.
&#8220;The General is a little heavy, but his wife
has vivacity enough to counterbalance him, and
I should say the brother is a fine fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s eyes opened wide with astonishment.
Forgetting all her good resolutions,
now that she and her cousin had so decidedly
shifted positions, she said excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Alan, I supposed you thought him
simply intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her cousin, in his turn, looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him better than I,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and it may be that that is his real character;
but I met him at the club the other night and
was rather struck with him. It may be all surface,
however. He is a good-looking fellow&mdash;and
has very good manners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good manners! Oh, Alan! His conduct,
the first time you met him, was really terrible;
it filled me with shame for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes; I remember that very well,&#8221; said
Decourcy, quietly; &#8220;but I rather fancied, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
certain signs, that that was mostly due to his
being at odds with you, in some way. Yes,&#8221;
he went on, looking faintly amused at the reminiscence,
&#8220;he evidently intended to annihilate me,
but when he saw that he had better
not think of it, I must say he gave up with a
good grace, and since then he has done everything
in his power to manifest an intention to
be civil. In this condition of affairs, I find
him a very likeable, intelligent fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you bear him no grudge for the manner
in which he treated you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Daisy! what&#8217;s the use of bearing
grudges? Life is much too short. And besides,
a great many people are like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of people? Vulgar people and
ignorant people, I suppose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not necessarily. I have often seen
such conduct from people whom I could not,
on the whole, call either ignorant or vulgar.
It seems to be the instinct with some men to
consider every stranger a blackguard, until he
has proved himself not to be one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>&#8220;It is abominable,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;perfectly
barbarous! Such people have no right
to claim to be civilized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In point of fact, it is only a very small class,
my dear, who can justly lay claim to that estate.
I understand your feeling. How it carries me
back! I used to feel much as you do, before I
went out into the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think a knowledge of the world
would make one more fastidious instead of less
so,&#8221; said Margaret, sturdily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are wrong in that. One learns
to take things as they come, and loses the
notion of having all things exactly to one&#8217;s
taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely such flagrant impoliteness as
Mr. Gaston&#8217;s would be condemned anywhere,&#8221;
said Margaret. &#8220;You should have seen his
treatment of Major King.&#8221;</p>

<p>She then proceeded to give a spirited account
of that episode, to her cousin&#8217;s manifest
interest and amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how your hot Southern blood did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
tingle!&#8221; he commented, as she ended her recital.
&#8220;You felt as if a crime had been committed
in your sight, which it was your sacred
duty to avenge&mdash;did you not? I had such
feelings once myself, and perhaps, in both our
cases, they may be traced to the same cause.
Constant observation of such a model as your
father presents would put most of the world
at a disadvantage. There is a fineness of grain
in him that one meets with but rarely anywhere.
With him the feeling is that every
man must be regarded and treated as a gentleman,
until he has proved himself not to be
one. It is a better way. But I think, after
all, Margaret, that absolute good-breeding is a
thing we must look for in individuals, and not
in classes. It certainly does not exist in any
class with which I have been thrown, and I
cannot quite see how it could, as long as our
social system of standards and rewards remains
what it is. Do you remember a clever squib
in <i>Punch, &agrave;propos</i> of all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>&#8220;I very rarely see <i>Punch</i>,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It represents a conversation on the deck of
an ocean steamer, between a beautiful American
girl, returning from Europe, and several
Englishmen, who are grouped about her. One
of these is saying: &#8216;Now, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, do tell us.
You&#8217;ve travelled a great deal, and seen the
world, where have you met with the most elegant,
refined, and high-bred men and women?&#8217;
&#8216;Among your British aristocracy,&#8217; replies the
young lady, frankly. Her response is greeted
with a flutter of delight by the group, and their
spokesman puts another question: &#8216;Now tell
us, on the other hand,&#8217; he says, &#8216;where you have
met with the greatest ill-breeding and vulgarity.&#8217;
The answer comes as promptly as
before: &#8216;Among your British aristocracy.&#8217;
That,&#8221; proceeded Decourcy, after waiting for
Margaret&#8217;s ready tribute of appreciation, &#8220;according
to my own small experience, states the
case exactly, and, with certain limitations, the
same thing is true of the aristocracy of every
country. A low-born ignoramus could never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
be the finished snob that a man of some enlightenment
may be; he wouldn&#8217;t know how.
But confess, Margaret,&mdash;hot little rebel as
you are!&mdash;have you never encountered the
elements of snobbishness among your own
people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I always supposed it came from
ignorance and was greatly due to the fact that,
since the war, our people have had so little opportunity
of seeing the world, and have become
insulated and prejudiced in consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something in that; but it was always
so, I fancy, more or less. We are by nature
and habit a self-opinionated race, with
certain honorable exceptions, of course. But
this I will say&mdash;by way of a little private
swagger between ourselves&mdash;that I think
we are a courteous people, indeed the most
courteous I have known, with more inherent
good-feeling for others. That ought to comfort
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margaret, rather wistfully; &#8220;but
there are so many other things. Our people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
are so indolent, it seems to me&mdash;at least since
the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always make me laugh, Daisy, when
you introduce that little phrase, &#8216;since the
war.&#8217; You seem to find in it a satisfactory
excuse for all the delinquencies of your beloved
people. But the South, my sweet cousin,
has never been a Utopia, any more than other
lands. Wheat and tares must grow together
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you call them my beloved people,&#8221;
said Margaret, after a little silence. &#8220;At
home they do not think me very patriotic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean by &#8216;they&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Charley Somers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by-the-way, I meant to ask about that
pretty young fellow,&#8221; said Decourcy. &#8220;I used
to make him very angry by telling him he ought
to induce Bassett to take a newspaper, and suggesting
that the name of the town should be
changed to Cosmopolis. I am afraid Charley
never loved me. I shudder still at the remembrance
of the scowls he would cast upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
me whenever I went near you. How is
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;not changed
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t followed my advice about the
paper, then? How about his voice? It bid
fair to be superb. I hope it has developed
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it has developed at all,&#8221; said
Margaret. &#8220;Certainly it has had no training
worthy the name. It is a shame to see him
throwing that magnificent gift away. I have
thought of it so much, in hearing Mr. Gaston
sing. He has no voice at all, compared to
Charley&#8217;s, but he has spent such patient labor
on its cultivation that his method is exquisite,
and his singing would charm any one. Isn&#8217;t it
a fine thing to think how he worked over it,
while all the time he was studying hard at his
profession too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Gaston is lucky enough to have won
your approbation, in one quarter, at least,
though he does come under your ban in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
another,&#8221; said Decourcy. &#8220;You are exacting,
Margaret, and severe in your ideals: I foresee
that I shall be afraid of you. It would be interesting
to make the acquaintance of the lucky
man who is destined to command your entire
approval, and win your fair hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret laughed brightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Eugenia says I shall never marry,&#8221;
she answered; &#8220;she says I expect as much as
if I were an heiress, and a beauty, and an intellectual
prodigy, all in one. But I tell her my
comfort is that the sort of man I should care for
invariably falls in love with his inferior.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the train glided into the station,
and the conversation between the cousins came
to an end.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">UNDER the stimulating pressure of recent
experiences Margaret had taken up her
music again, with great ardor and determination.
Mr. Gaston had encouraged her to believe
that she might yet make a good performer,
and had managed to instil into her some of his
own spirit of thinking it worth while to achieve
the best attainable, even though great proficiency
might be out of reach. There was so
little time during the day when she could
count upon remaining in undisturbed possession
of the piano that, for some time before
leaving Washington, she had been in the habit
of rising earlier and practising for an hour before
breakfast, and she was resolved that her
visit to Baltimore should not interfere with
this routine. Indeed, she would have felt its
interruption to be a serious moral retrogression,
and so, with Mrs. Guion&#8217;s sanction, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
kept up her morning labors, and when the
family met at breakfast every day, she had
already accomplished her allotted period of
practising. Alan used to laugh at her about it,
and tell her she was becoming Yankeeized.
He was apt to be late for breakfast himself,
and Mrs. Guion took a great deal of trouble in
having things kept hot for him, and would arrange
little delicacies for him, much as if he
had been an invalid lady, as Margaret more
than once remarked with a certain degree of
impatience. It quite irritated her to see how
his sister pampered and indulged him and how
carelessly, and as a matter of course, he accepted
it all.</p>

<p>The Guions had only recently come to Baltimore
from the South. Their old home had
been very near to Margaret&#8217;s, and she had consequently
seen much more of Mrs. Guion, of
late years, than of Alan. The children, of
whom there were three, ranging from two to
seven years of age, were cherished acquaintances
of Margaret&#8217;s, and hailed her arrival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
with a hearty enthusiasm, that she responded
to with much cordiality. Ethel, the eldest,
had been taught by her mother, long ago, to
call Miss Trevennon &#8220;Auntie Margaret,&#8221; and
Amy and Decourcy had, of course, adopted the
title. They were charming children, rather
delicate in health, and watched and guarded
with such care by their anxious mother, that
they had the air of frail exotics. Mr. Guion
had died when Decourcy was a baby, and it
was because Alan had decided to settle in
Baltimore for the practise of his profession,
the law, that Mrs. Guion had moved her
little family there. She was enthusiastically
attached to her only brother, and never wearied
of discoursing upon his perfections and displaying
the numberless useful and ornamental
presents that he lavished upon her children
and herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it good of Alan to insist upon our
coming to Baltimore, that he might make his
home with us?&#8221; said Mrs. Guion, talking to
her young cousin, the day after the latter&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
arrival. &#8220;So many young men would have
thought it a nuisance to be hampered by a
woman and three children; but he insisted on
our coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly see how he could regard you
in the light of a nuisance,&#8221; said Margaret,
smiling; &#8220;your chief object in life seems to be
to humor his whims and caprices. He could
certainly not secure such comfort as you administer
to him, in any bachelor-quarters on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>This view of the case had never occurred to
Mrs. Guion, and she rejected it almost indignantly,
and argued long to convince her cousin
that she was, in all respects, the favored one;
but without much success.</p>

<p>It was by a mere accident that Margaret
discovered, a day or two after her arrival,
that Alan&#8217;s sleeping-apartment, situated just
above the front drawing-room, had been exchanged
for one on the other side of the hall.
In an instant it flashed upon her that her
morning performance on the piano had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the cause of it. To be quite certain, however,
she went to Mrs. Guion and asked her directly
if it was not so.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find it out?&#8221; said Mrs.
Guion; &#8220;you were not to know anything about
it. The other room is quite as convenient for
Alan. He says he likes it just as well, and he
wouldn&#8217;t for the world have you know that
he moved on that account. But, you know,
he never could bear noise. Even the children
understand that they must be quiet when he
is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he an invalid, in any way?&#8221; asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no! but he always had that
objection to noise, and I think he is more set
in his ways now than ever. I tell him he
ought to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he values his personal ease so much, it
might be a mistake to imperil it by matrimony,&#8221;
said Margaret, with a touch of contempt
in her voice not discernible to her unsuspecting
cousin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>&#8220;Affluence and idleness have made him
luxurious,&#8221; said Margaret to herself, reflectively,
when Mrs. Guion had left her alone. &#8220;I
suppose those two things are apt to go together.
And yet Cousin Eugenia says Mr. Gaston has
always been well off, and certainly the veriest
pauper could not work harder! And
still&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence ended in a little sigh. There
was no denying the fact that Louis Gaston&#8217;s
descent from the pedestal upon which she had
mentally placed him, had been a great blow.</p>

<p>Miss Trevennon&#8217;s time passed very agreeably
in Baltimore. Mrs. Guion, as yet, had only
a small circle of friends, but most of these
called upon her cousin, and several invitations
resulted from these visits. As to Alan,
the number of invitations he received was
quite amusing. He had been twice to the
club, and had delivered only one or two of his
various letters, and made only one or two
visits, when the cards of invitation began to
pour in. He happened to have a few desirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
acquaintances in Baltimore, his appearance
was distinguished, and he was known to
be rich, and these three facts, taken together,
sufficiently account for the degree of popularity
of which he found himself possessed.</p>

<p>One thing that rather surprised Margaret
was the readiness with which her cousin would
throw aside other engagements in order to
drive her out, or take her to the theatre, or
contribute, in any way, to her enjoyment. He
even stayed at home one whole rainy evening,
when Mrs. Guion was engaged up-stairs with
one of the children, who was unwell, in order,
as he distinctly avowed, to have a long talk
with her.</p>

<p>When Miss Trevennon and Mr. Decourcy
found themselves alone in the drawing-room,
the latter threw himself, at full length, upon a
low lounge, drawn up before the fire, and, fixing
his eyes enjoyingly on Margaret, as she
sat opposite, he drew a long breath of restful
satisfaction, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now this is real enjoyment. You don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
know it, perhaps, but it is just what I have
longed for. Amy has really done this room
charmingly, and has contrived to get precisely
the atmosphere I like in it. The confusion
of sweet and pungent odors from those
plants yonder is just faint enough to be agreeable;
and, far above all, my fair cousin, with
her silken draperies and beautiful pose, puts a
climax to my happiness. You have a talent
for attitude, my Marguerite&mdash;do you know it?
You always place yourself to advantage. I
don&#8217;t know whether it is nature or art, but it is
equally admirable, in either case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret, who sat in a deep chair with her
arms laid along its padded sides, and her hands
lightly clasping the rounded ends, her long
silk gown falling away to the left, while her
figure was slightly turned toward her cousin
at her right, fixed her eyes upon the points of
her little slippers, crossed before her, and remained
profoundly still.</p>

<p>For a moment the young man looked at her
in silence, and then he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>&#8220;Why are you so quiet, dear Daisy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am unwilling to alter the pose that has
won your approbation,&#8221; she said demurely.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think if I retained it long enough
I might &#8216;be struck so,&#8217; as the man in <i>Patience</i>
says?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be inclined to discourage that
idea,&#8221; said Alan, &#8220;as I was about to ask you
to draw your seat a little nearer, and transfer
your hands from the chair&#8217;s arms to my head.
You know I always liked you to run your long
fingers through and through my hair. Have
you forgotten how you used to do it? I can
assure you I have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Margaret made no answer, he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were quite a child when you used first
to do it&mdash;a tall little maid, even then, with
such imperious ways! But you were always
willing to do anything for your big boy cousin,
and he has never forgotten you. All the time
he was at college, and afterward, when he went
abroad and travelled about in many strange
and distant places, he carried with him always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the image of that little maid, and when, at last,
he turned homeward, one of his pleasantest
visions was that of meeting her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had changed her position and
turned more directly toward him; she was
looking straight into his eyes, with her direct
and candid gaze, which his own met rather
dreamily. She did not speak in answer to
these fond assurances of his, but as she listened
she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you glad to hear that I have always
had this <i>tendre</i> for my sweet cousin, which
I somehow can&#8217;t get over, even yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Margaret, gently, &#8220;very
glad,&#8221; and she looked at him with a deep and
searching gaze, which he could not quite understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come nearer, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and take
your old place at my head, and try to twist
my short locks into curls, as you used to do.
You will discover a secret known only to myself
and the discreet fraternity of barbers.
Come and see!&#8221; and he extended a white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
hand, somewhat languidly, to draw her toward
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Margaret, drawing herself
upright, into an attitude of buoyant self-possession.
&#8220;You and the barbers may keep
your secret, for the present. I won&#8217;t intrude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but I want you. Come!&#8221; he said
urgently, still holding out the delicate hand,
on which a diamond sparkled.</p>

<p>But Margaret shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider,&#8221; she said, with a little smile;
&#8220;hadn&#8217;t I better stay where I am and pose for
you, &#8216;talking platitudes in stained-glass attitudes,&#8217;
than put myself there, out of sight, encroaching
upon the barbers&#8217; privileges in more
ways than one? As there is only one of me, I
think you had better let me stay where I am.
There ought to be five or six&mdash;one at your Sereneness&#8217;
head, and another at your feet. Two
with jingling anklets and bangles, to dance in
that space over yonder, and two just back of
them, to discourse sweet music on their &#8217;citherns
and citoles&#8217;!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>Decourcy smiled at her banter, but he fancied
he discerned in her voice a faint ring of
earnestness, tinctured with scorn, that disconcerted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of six,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when
I have the sweet ministrations of all, merged
into one?&mdash;the little maid of long ago! Her
comforting offices are an old experience, and,
without having seen her dance, I&#8217;m willing to
pit her against any pair of houris in the
Orient; and as to music, I prefer the piano to
citherns and citoles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially in the early morning hours,&#8221;
said Margaret, slyly, &#8220;when your Sereneness is
enjoying your nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you anything about that?&#8221; he
said, starting, and turning toward her abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed the truth and asked Amy, and
she had to own it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear you in the least, where I am
now. I hope you have not given up your
practising on my account. I am afraid you
have!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; answered Margaret, &#8220;my
effort is to make more noise, and I constantly
use the loud pedal. If my instrument had
been as movable as your apartment, I should
have followed you across the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you talk to me like this, Daisy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I think you ought to come down
in time for breakfast, and not give Amy the
trouble of having things prepared afresh for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy likes it,&#8221; he said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very fortunate, if she does,&#8221; said
Margaret; &#8220;but I fancy she would do it all
the same, whether she liked it or not. Amy
never thinks of herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, Mrs. Guion entered, having
at last soothed her little patient to sleep. Her
first act was to bring a light screen and put it
before her brother&#8217;s face, to shield it from the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy, why will you?&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;You
spoil Alan frightfully. He&#8217;s badly in need of
discipline.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>&#8220;I wish you would take me in hand,&#8221; he
said, looking at her from behind the screen
with an eager expression, that disconcerted
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Guion&#8217;s entrance introduced new topics,
and the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> between the cousins was not
renewed.</p>

<p>The next morning being rainy, Margaret betook
herself, after breakfast, to the little up-stairs
apartment which was the children&#8217;s general
play-room, and as the three little creatures
gathered around her, she drew Amy to her side
and asked her to tell her what she thought of
Baltimore on serious consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it one bit, Auntie Mard&#8217;ret,&#8221;
said Amy. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a nasty, hateful,
dirty place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Amy!&#8221; said Margaret, reproachfully,
&#8220;I am shocked at your using such words.
Where did a sweet little girl like you ever hear
such bad words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Auntie Mard&#8217;ret, I know a dreat deal
worse words than that,&#8221; said Amy, with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
eyes opened very wide. &#8220;Why, if I was to tell
you the words I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of, why you&#8217;d jump
up and wun out of the woom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy, I must insist upon your telling me,&#8221;
said Margaret, feeling in duty bound to restrain
her amusement, and administer the rebuke.
&#8220;What words do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Auntie Mard&#8217;ret,&#8221; said Amy, solemnly,
&#8220;they&#8217;s jes&#8217; is bad is they kin be&mdash;<i>awful</i>
words! I couldn&#8217;t never tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret insisted that she must be told,
and after much reluctance on Amy&#8217;s part, and
a demanded banishment of Ethel and Dee to
the other end of the room, she put her arms
around her cousin&#8217;s neck, and whispered in
awe-struck, mysterious tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinkin&#8217; of <i>devil</i> and <i>beast</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret caught the little creature in her
arms and kissed her repeatedly, in the midst
of such a merry outburst of laughter as made
reproof impossible.</p>

<p>Amy, who seemed greatly relieved to have
rid her conscience of this burden, without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
penance in consequence, ran off to play with
the other children, and Margaret had just cut
the leaves of a new magazine she had brought
up with her and begun to look over the illustrations,
when she became aware of a commotion
among the children at the other end of
the room and a confusion of excited voices.
Presently little Decourcy came running toward
her in much perturbation, and said, with
a rising sob:</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, is I a bullabulloo? Amy
says I&#8217;se a bullabulloo. Now, is I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Dee,&#8221; said Margaret, soothingly, &#8220;you
are no such thing. Tell Amy I say you are
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dee ran back to the closet, on the floor of
which Amy was seated dressing her doll, and
Margaret heard him say, triumphantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie Mard&#8217;rit says I&#8217;se not no bullabulloo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy, taking a pin out of her mouth to fasten
the insufficient scrap of ribbon which she had
been straining around her daughter&#8217;s clumsy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
waist, looked up into his face with great,
serious eyes, and said mysteriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dee, you <i>are</i> a bullabulloo. Auntie
Mard&#8217;rit don&#8217;t know it, and you don&#8217;t know it;
<i>but you are</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This idea was so hopelessly dreadful that
poor little Dee could control himself no
longer. He dropped his apronful of blocks
upon the floor, and burst into a howl of
despair.</p>

<p>Margaret flew to the rescue, and, lifting him
in her arms, carried him off to the window,
muttering soothing denials of his remotest
connection with bullabulloos. When he was
in some slight measure comforted, Margaret
called Amy to her and rebuked her sternly
for teasing her little brother. What was her
amazement to see Amy, as soon as she had
finished, look up at her with the same serious
gaze, and say, gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, he <i>is</i> a bullabulloo. You
don&#8217;t know it, and Dee don&#8217;t know it; but <i>he
is</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>At this poor Dee began to howl again, refusing
to be comforted, until it occurred to Margaret
to suggest that if he was a bullabulloo
Amy must be one, too, as she was his sister.
This idea, once mastered, proved consoling,
and Dee stopped crying. Margaret, to try to
banish the remembrance of his trouble, turned
him around to the window and called his attention
to the children next door, who were
running about the back yard in the rain and
apparently enjoying it immensely. Ethel and
Amy had joined them at the window, the latter
standing on tip-toe to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jack and Cora,&#8221; she said, still
grasping her doll with one arm, while she held
on to the window-ledge with the other. &#8220;Oh,
Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, they&#8217;re such awful bad children.
They don&#8217;t mind their mamma nor
nuthin&#8217;. You jes&#8217; ought to see how bad they
are. I jes&#8217; expeck they&#8217;ll all grow up to be
Yankees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think they&#8217;ll grow up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
be Yankees, Amy?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Did anybody
ever tell you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, but they&#8217;re so awful
bad; and if they&#8217;re that bad when they&#8217;re
little, I bet they <i>will</i> grow up to be Yankees.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Guion entered, and Margaret
related the story to her with great zest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>do</i> you suppose they got hold of such
an idea?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine,&#8221; said Mrs. Guion, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure they never got it from me. Alan will insist
that they did, as he considers me a most
bigoted rebel. But certainly I have never
taught any such sentiment as that to the children.
They must simply have imbibed it with
the air they have breathed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an excellent story,&#8221; said Margaret,
laughing over it still; &#8220;I shall have no rest
until I have told it to Mr. Gaston.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EVER since Mrs. Gaston had called attention
to the fact that Alan Decourcy had
a habit of watching her, Margaret had been
conscious that it was really the case. He always
listened attentively when she spoke, applauding
by eloquent looks and smiles when
her sentiments pleased him, and looking
annoyed and disappointed when they did not.
She could not help seeing that he was studying
her with a deliberateness she felt somewhat
inclined to resent.</p>

<p>It was hard to cherish any feeling of resentment
against him, however, during that pleasant
week in Baltimore, for he was kindness
itself, contributing in every possible way to
her comfort and enjoyment. Every night there
was something pleasant going on, and Alan
was always at hand, to act as escort, if no one
else held the place. Margaret was delighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
with Baltimore, and when she expressed herself
to this effect, Mr. Decourcy showed such
manifest approval of the sentiment that she
half regretted it the next minute. She was
beginning to feel a little disconcerted by certain
signs she saw in Alan.</p>

<p>This young lady got so much pleasure and
entertainment out of everything, that it often
surprised her to catch glimpses of a carefully
concealed <i>ennui</i> in the expression of her
cousin&#8217;s guarded countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not like to be as thoroughly
initiated as you are, Alan,&#8221; she said to him one
day. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen and done pretty much
everything, I suppose, and nothing has any
particular zest for you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You audacious young fledgeling!&#8221; exclaimed
her cousin. &#8220;How dare you make me
out such a <i>blas&eacute;</i> old fellow? How old am I, do
you suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t quite know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just barely thirty-three&mdash;not entirely
superannuated yet!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>&#8220;About three years older than Mr. Gaston!&#8221;
said Margaret, reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand the inflection of your
voice,&#8221; said Alan, rather eagerly; &#8220;do I seem
that much older than he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; answered Margaret, still
in the same thoughtful tone. &#8220;Mr. Gaston is
such a busy man that he bears the impress of
cares and responsibilities, and that makes him
seem older; but in his feelings he seems
worlds younger than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And haven&#8217;t I cares and responsibilities too,
I&#8217;d like to know! Wait till I&#8217;m fairly launched
in my profession, and see how I will peg away
at my briefs and documents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Alan!&#8221; said Margaret, smiling indulgently,
in a way that irritated him; &#8220;it is impossible
to imagine you really at work. Have
you ever practised at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Circumstances have prevented,
and I remained abroad much longer than I
had any idea of doing; but one thing after another
detained me. After Christmas, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
I am going to open an office and go to work in
earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with confidence, but his tone did
not impose upon his cousin, who in her heart
had but small belief in his work. The fact
was becoming more and more evident to her,
that the nomadic life this elegant young gentleman
had led had held him back from strong
purposes, however much it had advanced him
in social accomplishments and graces.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a man has done nothing, from choice, up
to thirty,&#8221; she said to herself, reflectively,
&#8220;the chances are that, if the power of choice
remains, he will continue to do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you are pleased with Baltimore,
Margaret,&#8221; said her cousin, interrupting
her reverie. &#8220;How do you think you should
like it as a residence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I should like my home, wherever it
chanced to be,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;It is people,
and not places, that make one&#8217;s happiness, I
think. I am sure I could be happy wherever
my dear father and mother were.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>&#8220;But you cannot have them always. By-and-by
some one must take their place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;I suppose so, but I
try not to think of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you never think of marriage, Margaret?
I suppose all young ladies must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not often, as applied to myself,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think matrimony desirable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Margaret, a little
uneasily. &#8220;Not as we usually see it, certainly.
I suppose under the very best conditions marriage
is the happiest life&mdash;but I know nothing
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite sure it is the happiest life,&#8221;
said Alan, &#8220;for both men and women, and it is
the greatest possible mistake to put it off too
long. Don&#8217;t be too fastidious as to conditions,
Margaret, and too high-flown in your notions.
Mutual liking and respect, and congeniality of
tastes are a good enough foundation&mdash;the rest
will follow. A cheerful disposition is an immense
consideration, and that you have. You
will always make the best of whatever comes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
I don&#8217;t think I ever saw a woman better fitted
for matrimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly and looked at her
with such intentness, that Margaret felt herself
somewhat ill at ease, and was relieved
when the door burst open and Decourcy came
running in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, Ethel says you&#8217;re not my
really auntie,&#8221; he said, wofully; &#8220;you is, now&mdash;ain&#8217;t
you, Auntie Mard&#8217;rit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you just the same as if I were, Dee,&#8221;
said Margaret, lifting him to her knee. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t be your real auntie, you know, because
I&#8217;m not your mother&#8217;s or your father&#8217;s
sister. Can you understand that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Gregg is Jack and Cora&#8217;s auntie,&#8221;
said Amy, who had come to take part in the
discussion, &#8220;and she&#8217;s not their mamma&#8217;s
sister or their papa&#8217;s either; she only married
their uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if Margaret married your uncle, she
would be your really auntie, too,&#8221; said Alan,
quietly. &#8220;She could settle the whole matter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
if she would, and don&#8217;t you think she might?
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, won&#8217;t you please
marry uncle?&#8221; cried Amy, imploringly, while
Dee, partially seizing the idea, repeated
faintly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie Mard&#8217;rit, peese marry uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away, children,&#8221; said Margaret, provoked
to feel herself blushing. &#8220;Alan, how
can you put such nonsense into their heads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it is but too true that you consider
it nonsense,&#8221; he said, with a gravity that
surprised her. Immediately afterward he left
the room, and Margaret found herself alone
with the children, who insisted on pushing
the question to its remotest issue with a persistency
that was almost distracting.</p>

<p>After this it was impossible but that she
should realize that her cousin was studying
her with a purpose. She could hardly suppose
that he thought seriously of asking her to
marry him, and yet the interest he displayed
in trying to direct her opinions pointed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
way. She made a strong effort to shake off
the idea. Its deliberateness shocked her.
Charming as her cousin was, his calm philosophicalness
often irritated her, and she was
at times inclined to believe him cold-blooded
and selfish, until perhaps, just afterward, some
act of kindness to herself or his sister or the
children made her heartily ashamed of this
suspicion. And, indeed, it was an easy thing
to judge Alan Decourcy kindly. So he kept
his place as a trusty and beloved kinsman.</p>

<p>Shortly before the end of Margaret&#8217;s allotted
week in Baltimore, Mrs. Gaston forwarded to
her an invitation to a large party to be given
by some people who happened to be friends of
Alan Decourcy also, and insisted that both
of them should come over in time for the entertainment.
Margaret&#8217;s week would be out,
she said, and no extension of leave would be
granted. So she was to come without fail, and
to bring Mr. Decourcy with her. Alan readily
acquiesced in the arrangement, and at the
proper time they set forth together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>Margaret was feeling particularly well-disposed
toward her cousin that afternoon, as
they steamed along in the express train together.
She had the recollection of a host of
kind acts toward herself stored away in her
mind, and it seemed to come almost more
naturally than usual to her to like this pleasant,
considerate, affectionate cousin.</p>

<p>When they had reached Washington, and
were driving swiftly along the smooth asphalt
pavements in Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s snug coup&eacute;,
Margaret said, cordially:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done <i>everything</i> to make my visit a
happy one, Alan! I do thank you so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a happy time to me,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;<i>so</i> happy! How capitally we get on together,
Daisy&mdash;don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It always makes me think of dear papa
to hear you call me Daisy,&#8221; answered the girl,
instinctively avoiding a direct answer to his
appeal. &#8220;I had forgotten that you called
me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have adopted it intentionally,&#8221; he said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
&#8220;Margaret seems cold, and I want to get rid of
the sense of distance between us which our
long separation has engendered, for who knows
but by-and-by what you are pleased to call
nonsense now may come to look differently, as
use familiarizes it? Don&#8217;t turn upon me in
that sudden way, dear. I wouldn&#8217;t startle you
for the world. I only want you to promise to
think of me often, until after a while I come to
see you down in Bassett, and we can talk
things over quietly and calmly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always think of you as a kind and
dear cousin,&#8221; answered Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I cannot promise I shall always be
content with that,&#8221; he said, bending toward
her, with a motion of great gentleness, and
softly laying his gloved hand over hers. &#8220;My
sweet Margaret,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;my strong
hope is, that some day I can teach you to think
of me as I would have you. And, meantime, I
can wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret made an effort to withdraw her
hand, but he held it in a close, detaining clasp,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
and, looking up, she met his eyes fixed on her,
with a gaze so sweet and tender, that it somehow
seemed to soothe, while it agitated her.
Once more she attempted to withdraw her
hand, and this time he released it, but before
doing so he raised it to his lips and kissed it.</p>

<p>Margaret felt deeply disturbed. It was
something very new to her to see this phase in
her cousin&#8217;s relationship toward her, and the
very fact that she felt in her heart no response
to these signs of tenderness, distressed her.
She knew the time must come when she would
have to deny and thwart him, and the idea
gave her pain. If she had hitherto doubted
that he really loved her, she doubted it no
longer. That look of his, as he lifted her hand
to kiss it, made doubt impossible. It was no
cool, cousinly affection; it was a passionate
emotion that looked out from his eyes.</p>

<p>She felt relieved when the carriage stopped
at General Gaston&#8217;s door, and Alan, after handing
her out, took leave, to be driven to his
hotel to dine and dress. The remembrance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
that look of his would not be shaken off, however,
and she appeared before Mrs. Gaston in
a somewhat pensive mood.</p>

<p>Cousin Eugenia was delighted to see her,
and declared she had missed her unendurably.
She informed her, hurriedly, that they were all
well, and that Louis was in New York, having
been there ever since the day after her own
departure for Baltimore; and then they fell to
discussing Margaret&#8217;s costume for the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;My white silk is all ready,&#8221; said Margaret,
somewhat listlessly. &#8220;I have not worn it yet,
you know. It is high, and perhaps better
suited to a dinner, but I like it, and suppose it
will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That splendid old lace would make it elegant
enough for any occasion,&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston;
&#8220;and as to the high neck, somehow that
style suits you, in spite of the eminent presentability
of your neck and arms. But go
now to your room and take a good nap. Ring
for a cup of tea when you get up. I want you
to look very fresh to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>When Margaret entered her apartment, she
caught sight of a letter on her dressing-table,
and immediately her brows contracted. She
knew the hand. It was from Charley Somers,
and, to tell the truth, this young gentleman
was somewhat in disgrace. He had some
friends in Washington, and, a short time back,
he had written to Margaret to ask her to
allow him to come on and see her, with the
ostensible purpose of visiting these friends.
Margaret had written at once, and distinctly
forbidden him to come. The mere suggestion
made her indignant. It had the air of asserting
a claim when no shadow of such existed.
She supposed she had finally settled the matter,
and what had he to say in this letter? She
tore it open hastily and ran her eyes down the
length of its pages; when she reached the end
she threw it from her, with a motion of angry
indignation. Mr. Somers wrote to say that
the tone of her letter had made him feel so uneasy
that, even at the risk of incurring her displeasure,
he was coming on to Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Margaret hastily pulled out her watch. There
was yet time to catch the Southern mail. She
threw off her hat and wraps, and sitting down
at her desk scratched off a few hurried lines,
saying to Mr. Somers, that he might come to
Washington or not, exactly as it suited his
pleasure, but forbidding him, in plain terms, to
call upon her in the event of his doing so.
Without pausing to read it over, she addressed
and sealed the letter, and rang for a servant to
post it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Miss Trevennon, dressed for the
ball, descended to join her cousin that
memorable December evening, she looked undeniably
lovely, and so Mrs. Gaston admitted
to herself with supreme satisfaction. The
young girl&#8217;s tall beauty was superbly displayed
by this rather severe costume&mdash;with
its heavy, gleaming drapery falling about her,
white and plain. The flounces of rich lace
made a splendid trimming for the long skirt,
which trailed behind her in a graceful, shimmering
mass, and the pointed body outlined to
perfection her round and pliant waist. The
dress was cut high, and a fall of the lovely
lace finished the throat and sleeves.</p>

<p>Miss Trevennon&#8217;s clear-cut, soft-tinted face
was somewhat inanimate this evening. The
ball had lost much of its charm since she had
contemplated the prospect in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
In the first place, the possibility of Charley
Somers coming to Washington troubled her,
and, in the second, Alan Decourcy&#8217;s words and
looks, with a chance of their repetition this
evening, made her uneasy. Besides these,
there was a feeling of disappointment, all the
keener for being unowned, even to herself, that
Louis Gaston should not be here to welcome
her back, and to share the interest and pride
Cousin Eugenia so evidently took in her appearance
at this ball.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination, Mrs. Gaston
and Margaret, escorted by General Gaston,
were passing through the main hall on their
way to the dressing-rooms, when they came
upon Alan Decourcy, with a sumptuously apparelled
lady on his arm. She was a decidedly
pretty woman, and Margaret observed that she
clung to her companion with an air of the
friendliest familiarity. She also observed that
her pink gauze costume was somewhat <i>decollet&eacute;</i>,
and that a strap of black velvet stood in lieu
of a sleeve across her white shoulder, a similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
bit supporting a superb pendant of diamonds,
which ornamented her fair, round throat.</p>

<p>This lady bowed affably to Mrs. Gaston, and
regarded Margaret with a broad stare. Alan,
of course, spoke also, but for some reason
Margaret avoided doing more than just glancing
at him as she passed on toward the staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so Mrs. Vere already has your cousin
in her toils!&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston, as they were
approaching the dressing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that Mrs. Vere?&#8221; said Margaret.
&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s one of the most noted of the
married belles!&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston. &#8220;If Mr.
Decourcy were not a man of the world and
well able to take care of himself, it might be
well for you to warn him. As it is, I feel no
anxiety about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is Mr. Vere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Vere&#8217;s husband. He may or may not
be here. He&#8217;s apt to turn up in the supper-room.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>Margaret said no more, but set herself to
the adjustment of her toilet with a certain air
of preoccupation. Having ascertained by a
glance that her costume was in order, she
stood looking very thoughtful as she waited
for her cousin, whose touches here and there
consumed a much longer time.</p>

<p>When the two ladies emerged from the
dressing-room together, they found Alan Decourcy,
with General Gaston, awaiting them.
He had freed himself from Mrs. Vere, in some
way, and offered his arm to take Margaret into
the room. She laid her hand within it lightly,
and they followed General and Mrs. Gaston in
silence.</p>

<p>After they had spoken to their hostess and
her daughters, Decourcy led Miss Trevennon
away to make the tour of the rooms, which
were ablaze with lights and flowers, and gorgeous
to behold.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something very distinguished
about this dress you are wearing, Margaret,&#8221;
he said, in a tone that was caressingly sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
&#8220;or is it, perhaps, my cousin&#8217;s lovely face and
figure that make it appear so? You are looking
your very best, yet I never saw you so
devoid of color.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the contrast with Mrs. Vere&#8217;s gorgeousness,
perhaps!&#8221; said Margaret, with a rather
strained little laugh. &#8220;When did you meet
Mrs. Vere, by-the-way?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned suddenly, and looked at her with
a glance of keen scrutiny, but, seeing the utter
unsuspiciousness of her frank gaze, he said
carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Vere? Oh, she&#8217;s a very old friend!
I hardly remember the time when I didn&#8217;t
know Antoinette Vere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know of her being in Washington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; I saw her when I was in
town, the other day. She lives here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I wonder you did not tell me you
had this great friend living here, and make
her come to see me!&#8221; said Margaret, in her
honest way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; he said, somewhat
constrainedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d care
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned, then, and called her attention to
some especially pretty bit of decoration, and
Mrs. Vere was not mentioned again.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Leary came up to
speak to Miss Trevennon, and, soon after, one
or two other acquaintances appeared, and
Margaret was importuned for dances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not dance this evening,&#8221; she said,
forming the resolution suddenly. She had not
thought of the matter before, but when the
time came she found herself indisposed to
dance. There were strong protests from the
young gentlemen, but these her decided manner
soon silenced, and when Mr. Leary offered
his arm, to take her to look for a seat, she
looked around for Decourcy and found that he
was gone.</p>

<p>For a long while after this, she had not time
to think of her cousin. Scores of people were
presented to her, by Mrs. Gaston and others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and the General whispered to her that his
popularity with the young gentlemen this
evening was something phenomenal. She
went into the drawing-room and looked on for
a while, and though she kept to her resolution
she might have had two partners for every
dance, if she had chosen. Most of the men
whom she declined to dance with manifested
an entire willingness to stop and talk instead,
and throughout the evening she was so well
attended, that Cousin Eugenia, who had heard
with quaking of her resolution not to dance,
admitted to herself, in the end, that it had
given her young cousin a more distinguished
appearance.</p>

<p>When the evening was growing old, and the
flowers began to droop and the music to flag;
when the girls began to look the worse for too
much dancing, and the men, in many cases, the
worse for too much wine, Miss Trevennon, finding
herself a little weary, yielded to the suggestion
of her companion for the moment, who
happened to be Lord Waring, and allowed herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
to be led to a cool, dim recess in the conservatory,
where she sank into a seat to wait,
while Lord Waring went for a glass of water for
her. It was very still and quiet here. Almost
every one was occupied either in the supper-room
or in dancing, and Margaret supposed
herself to be quite alone, until the sound of
low-toned voices arrested her attention. Turning,
she caught sight, between the branches of
some densely leaved palms, of the figures of a
man and woman. The latter&#8217;s back was turned,
but Margaret recognized the pink costume
and smooth, bare shoulders. The head was
raised to meet the ardent gaze of the man
who bent above her. This man&#8217;s face was
turned full toward Margaret, and she, too,
could see that gaze&mdash;a tender, fervid look that,
but a few hours since, had been bent upon herself.
Instinctively she closed her eyes, afraid to
look longer, and feeling a quick pang of horror
as she remembered that so recently this man
had kissed her hand. Thank Heaven he had
never, for one instant, touched her heart&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
she cared not an atom for him! But suppose
it had been different! Suppose the tenderness
he had so successfully counterfeited, the significant
words she had so implicitly believed,
had awakened an answering tenderness in her
heart!</p>

<p>As these hurried thoughts rushed through
her mind, she rose to her feet, confused and
agitated. Again her troubled gaze rested for
one instant upon another vision of those two
figures through the vista of flowers and leaves,
but it was for an instant only, for she felt a
swift instinct of flight, and forgetting Lord
Waring and the fact that he would expect
to find her where he had left her, she fled
from the conservatory and entered the room
beyond. Bewildered, agitated, weak, uncertain,
she looked about her with a troubled
gaze, and met the steadfast eyes of Louis
Gaston.</p>

<p>With a look of joyful relief she hastened toward
him and placed her hand, with a confiding
motion, within the arm he extended. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
calm and self-collected aspect, the firm support
of his strong arm, the repose of his quiet
manner, the freshness of his evening toilet,
recently made, which contrasted so pleasantly
with the somewhat dishevelled and flushed appearance
of many of the men at this late hour,
all these were so restful and reassuring that
Margaret drew a long breath of contentment
to find herself so safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You were the very last person I expected to
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I returned from New York by the evening
train, and, late as it was, I concluded to dress
and come to the ball. I have seen my hostess,
who has kindly forgiven my tardiness, and my
next thought was to find you. I was in the act
of seeking you in the supper-room when you
unexpectedly appeared before me, solitary and
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was <i>so</i> glad to see you,&#8221; she said, with
the unconscious simplicity a child might have
shown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>He took her words as naturally as they were
uttered, and said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to be alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord Waring was with me,&#8221; she said,
suddenly, remembering her errant knight.
&#8220;He went to get me some water. I wonder
where he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Lord Waring appeared at
the door of the conservatory, glass in hand.</p>

<p>Margaret hurriedly made her apologies, explaining
her having caught sight of Mr. Gaston
unexpectedly, his recent return from New
York, etc.</p>

<p>His lordship accepted her explanation in
good part, and when Margaret had drunk the
water rather eagerly he went off to return the
glass, saying he would see her again.</p>

<p>He had scarcely disappeared when Gaston
and Margaret, going out into the hall, saw Mrs.
Vere and Alan Decourcy coming toward them.</p>

<p>Gaston suddenly stood still, detaining his
companion by a slight pressure of the arm, and
said, hurriedly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>&#8220;It is just possible that Mrs. Vere may ask
you to join a theatre-party she is getting up
for to-morrow evening. Forgive me if I take
the liberty of suggesting that you shall decline
if she should do so. Make an engagement to
go with me instead, and just excuse yourself
on the plea of a previous engagement. I hope
you will pardon my venturing to advise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;but she will
not ask me. I do not know her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vere, however, was coming straight toward
them, and she now stopped in front of
them, and giving Louis a tap with her fan,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Present me to Miss Trevennon,&#8221; and when
Gaston had complied, she went on in a rather
boisterous tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been teasing your cousin to present
me to you all the evening, Miss Trevennon;
but I suppose he wanted the monopoly of you,
for he would not even bring me into your
neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have been that he wanted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
monopoly of yourself,&#8221; said Gaston, looking at
her keenly and speaking in his quietest tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s more than you&#8217;ll ever want,
then!&#8221; said Mrs. Vere, pertly; &#8220;so you can
just keep yourself out of the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have every intention of doing so, madam,&#8221;
said Gaston, gravely. &#8220;I know my
place, and I value my peace of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vere flashed a quick, vindictive glance
at him, as he uttered these quiet words, and
then turning to Margaret, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you to join a little theatre-party
I am giving to-morrow evening, Miss
Trevennon. There will be eight of us, and we
are going to see <i>As You Like It</i>, and have a
little supper at my house afterward. Now
don&#8217;t say you have any other engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I must,&#8221; said Margaret, conscious
of the insincerity of the qualifying term,
and yet too grateful to Louis for preparing
her for this contingency to feel very contrite
on account of it. &#8220;I have already pledged
myself elsewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>&#8220;How tiresome!&#8221; said Mrs. Vere, darting a
suspicious glance at Louis, which he met with
imperturbable gravity. &#8220;By-the-way, I called
on you while you were in Baltimore. I suppose
you got my card.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, without waiting for an answer, she
moved away, on Decourcy&#8217;s arm, saying, as if
half involuntarily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I detest that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Decourcy, who was looking somewhat preoccupied,
made no answer, until she gave his
arm a little jerk and said, with the petulance
of a child:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Why don&#8217;t
you speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I say, except that I feel deeply
sorry for poor Gaston, and appropriately
grateful that I do not happen to be in his
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke in his softest tones, but Mrs. Vere
knew instinctively that her spell was, for the
time being, broken. Well! it had been broken
before, she reflected, and she had always succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
in mending it, and she felt confident
she could do so again.</p>

<p>Meantime, as Margaret and Louis walked
away, to look for Mrs. Gaston, the former said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not rather odd that Mrs. Vere didn&#8217;t
ask you to join her party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; said Louis. &#8220;She wrote me a note,
which was forwarded to me in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you do?&#8221; asked Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excused myself on the score of another
engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began, and then
stopped with uplifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he answered, smiling; &#8220;but I
foresaw at least the possibility that you would
be propitious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s angry with you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely. She&#8217;s been angry with me
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, until to-night, that she was
an old friend of Alan&#8217;s,&#8221; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; he answered, indifferently; &#8220;it&#8217;s
an affair of long standing, I hear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said Margaret, facing
him with a sudden surprise, and then, remembering
the scene she had witnessed in the
conservatory, she averted her eyes, and was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I merely meant,&#8221; he answered, in a tone of
quick regret, &#8220;that I happened to hear Waring
say that they were friends in London, last year.
Mr. and Mrs. Vere spent the season there, and
your cousin happening to be there also, naturally
saw them often&mdash;all being Americans together.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point they caught sight of Mrs. Gaston,
and Margaret hastened to join her, and so
the subject was very willingly dropped by
them both.</p>

<p>Cousin Eugenia declared and reiterated
that Margaret had been a shining success at
this ball, but of that the girl thought and cared
little. But for many days to come, the recurring
thoughts of that evening brought with
them certain memories that rankled, as well as
certain others that comforted and soothed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;AND so Mrs. Vere wanted you in her
theatre-party!&#8221; said Cousin Eugenia to
Margaret, the next morning, as they were driving
about in a flutter of preparation for Christmas.
Margaret had sent off a charming box
home, and she was now assisting Mrs. Gaston
in the completion of her various Christmas
schemes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered quietly, &#8220;and I declined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Louis told me about it. It&#8217;s just as well
you got out of it. He was afraid he had ventured
too far in advising you. He said he
felt he had no sort of right to do it, and
that, in most cases, he should have held his
peace; but he couldn&#8217;t bear to think of you
in the midst of Mrs. Vere&#8217;s set, and he found
the impulse to prevent it too strong to be resisted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>&#8220;He was quite right,&#8221; said Margaret, feeling
a little throb of pleasure in the considerate interest
implied in what Mr. Gaston had said.
&#8220;I should not have wanted to go, in any case,
but I might not have known how to avoid it,
and he gave me the means. I felt very thankful
to him. But what is it that makes both
you and Mr. Gaston distrust Mrs. Vere?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cousin Eugenia gave a little shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Vere is extremely pretty,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and of course she has admirers. She is certainly
very free in her ways with them, but I
know no more than that, and I certainly don&#8217;t
care to know more. I asked Louis why he objected
to your going with her, and he said, with
that frown of his, that you could not possibly
find any pleasure in her acquaintance. He
would say nothing more, but I felt sure, by the
way he looked, that there was a good deal kept
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder at Alan Decourcy,&#8221; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston. &#8220;I don&#8217;t.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
I have long since ceased to wonder at any
man&#8217;s admiring any woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can he? He is so fastidious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I used the wrong word,&#8221; said
Mrs. Gaston; &#8220;to admire a woman is one
thing and to find her amusing is another. I
fancy Mr. Decourcy finds Mrs. Vere amusing&mdash;most
men do, indeed&mdash;and your cousin is
the sort of man with whom that is paramount.
With men of a certain type the woman who
can furnish them most amusement will ever
have the strongest hold upon them, and to
that type I rather think your fascinating
cousin belongs. As I said, most men find
Mrs. Vere amusing, and as her husband does
not look after her at all, the coast is clear for
them to come and be amused; and they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Mr. Gaston finds her amusing,&#8221;
said Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Louis! I should think not!&#8221; said Mrs.
Gaston, warmly. &#8220;My dear, you don&#8217;t know
Louis yet&mdash;perhaps you never will. Very few
people besides Edward and I know what that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
boy is. I know him, through and through,
and I unhesitatingly declare that he&#8217;s an
angel. I believe he&#8217;s of a different grain from
other men. Mrs. Vere could no more ensnare
him than she could put shackles on a mist-cloud;
and for that reason&mdash;because she knows
her usual darts are powerless with him&mdash;she
is feverishly anxious to get him in her toils.
I&#8217;ll do her the justice to say her efforts have
been masterly. She&#8217;s left no stone unturned.
She&#8217;s tried the musical dodge, and invited him
to warble duets with her. That must have
been a temptation, for you know how he loves
music, and her voice is charming. She&#8217;s tried
the charity dodge, and has come to him with
tears in her eyes to get him to make plans for
cottages she proposed to erect for poor people
on her estate in the outer antipodes. He told
me about that himself, and what do you suppose
was his answer to her appeal? He told
her that when she had made arrangements
with the builder to go to work, to tell the latter
to write to him on the subject and he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
gladly furnish the plans for her cottages and
feel himself honored in advancing her good
work&mdash;begged her not to mention the question
of payment, and bowed her out of his office
with the assurance that the builder&#8217;s letter
should find him most willing to co-operate,
and insisted that she should wash her fair
hands of these dry business details and leave
them entirely to the builder and himself. She
plucked up courage on the landing, to tell him
she had some plans to submit. He replied to
this that, as he had long since submitted himself
and all his designs and aspirations to his
partner, and as he did not venture to call his
soul, much less his squares and angles, his
own, without the approbation of Mr. Ames,
her plans must be submitted to the firm at
New York, where he would promise to give
them his circumspect attention under the
judicious eye of his chief. It must have been
a funny scene,&#8221; said Cousin Eugenia, smiling.
&#8220;Poor Mrs. Vere! She let him alone severely
for some time after that, but she finally began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
again on another tack. I think she is beginning
to understand now that there is one man
who can resist her, and when once she is quite
persuaded that she is vanquished, how she
will hate him! There&#8217;s nothing she wouldn&#8217;t
do to avenge herself; but I fancy Louis is as
far beyond the range of her revenge as he is of
her fascination. The truth is, as to Louis,&#8221;
Cousin Eugenia went on, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, &#8220;that he&#8217;s radically cold-blooded. He&#8217;s
affectionate to his friends and relatives, and
really fond of many of them, but he&#8217;s absolutely
unemotional&mdash;not to be roused to deep
feeling. But for this fact I fear Mrs. Vere&#8217;s
efforts would have been long since crowned
with success. It is really a valuable trait for
a man to have, if it were only for its uniqueness,
but occasionally it&#8217;s a little bit exasperating.
Who but Louis, for instance, would have
lived all these weeks in the same house with a
charming girl like you without falling, at least
a little, in love with her? For you are a
charming girl, my dear, and Louis accurately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
appreciates the fact; but there it ends. At
first I thought I saw signs of a speedy capitulation,
but it came to nothing. I ought to have
known the frogginess of my brother-in-law
better. I should have liked Louis to fall in
love with you, no matter how it ended. It
would have been nice to have you for a sister
and neighbor, and if that was not to be, it
would have been a satisfaction to see Louis
stirred out of his eternal calm, and concerning
himself about something over and above designs
and estimates. But I am afraid I am
never to have the supreme delight of seeing
Louis love-lorn. And you, my dear,&#8221; said
Cousin Eugenia, turning to look at her, &#8220;I begin
to fear you&#8217;re not very far from being
rather froggy yourself. It&#8217;s a very good thing
that you&#8217;ve taken no more of a fancy to Louis,
as it all turns out&mdash;(I fancied you, too, were in
some danger at first!)&mdash;but I do wonder how
you have kept so cool about that captivating
young man, your cousin, with his sweet, caressing
smiles and artful, foreign ways. The Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Vere episode would have been rather a blow,
I fear, if you had set your affections in that
quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole,&#8221; said Margaret, smiling, &#8220;it
seems to me that I am escaping a good many
breakers by remaining fancy free. But here
we are at our destination.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the conversation ended.</p>

<p>During this day&mdash;the one that followed the
party&mdash;Margaret received a note from Charley
Somers, bearing a Washington post-mark.
Observing this, her first angry thought was to
return it unopened, so indignant was she at his
persistence, and when she presently decided to
read it, its humble and imploring tone did not
mollify her in the least. Her letter of course
had not reached him, and he had grown impatient
and concluded not to wait to hear from
her.</p>

<p>She wrote him a few lines, declining explicitly
to see him, feeling herself justified in
taking so extreme a measure, as lesser ones
had failed to repress the young man&#8217;s ardor.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON Christmas-eve, after dinner, as General
and Mrs. Gaston, Miss Trevennon and Mr.
Louis Gaston were seated around the drawing-room
fire, a card of invitation was brought in
by Thomas, and delivered to General Gaston.
As he took it and scanned it through his
glasses, a perceptible gleam of satisfaction
came into his eyes, and he handed it to Mrs.
Gaston, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;A card for General Morton&#8217;s supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; returned his wife, with a reflection
of his gratified expression. &#8220;Really, this
is very kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she took the card and looked at it, Margaret
surveyed her wonderingly. Turning her
eyes away from her cousin&#8217;s face, an instant
later, she saw that Louis Gaston was regarding
her with a sort of deprecating amusement.
He was seated near to her, and so he alone distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
her words, when she murmured, in
an undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How strange are the customs of France&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled as she said it, and Cousin Eugenia,
who saw the smile, but missed the
words she had uttered, said explainingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This supper of General Morton&#8217;s is an annual
affair. He has given one on New Year&#8217;s
night ever since he has been in Washington.
They are limited to twenty-five gentlemen, and
of course these are carefully selected. It is
always the most <i>recherch&eacute;</i> stag-party of the season,
and one is sure of meeting there the most
distinguished and agreeable people the city
will afford. He has always been so kind in
asking Edward, though of course the invitations
are greatly in demand, and residents cannot
always expect to receive them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing further was said about the matter
just then, but it was evident that this attention
from General Morton had put Mrs. Gaston
in unusually high spirits, and her husband, on
his part, was scarcely less elated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>A little later, when Louis and Margaret happened
to be alone, the former said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would tell me what it was that
amused you about that invitation. The system
of social tactics, of which you are the exponent,
begins to interest me extremely. What was it
that brought that puzzled look to your face
just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I really tell?&#8221; the girl asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray do&mdash;frankly. I&#8217;m so interested to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering who this General Morton
could be, that a card to his supper should be
deemed such an acquisition. I have discovered
the fact that you Gastons are proud of your lineage,
and, as I have heard it said that yours is
one of the few really historical families of America,
perhaps it should not be wondered at. Who
then, can General Morton be, I was thinking,
to be in a position to confer honor on the Gastons?
I suppose he&#8217;s some one very grand,
but I&#8217;m such an ignoramus that I really don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
know who the Mortons are, when they&#8217;re at
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Morton&#8217;s origin was very common,&#8221;
said Louis. &#8220;Certainly, he has no sort
of claim to aristocratic distinction. He has a
high official position and is very rich and a
very good-natured, sensible sort of man, but it
is out of the question that he could, socially
speaking, confer honor upon my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet it was evident,&#8221; began Margaret&mdash;but
she stopped abruptly, and Louis made no
motion to help her out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said, presently, &#8220;that,
through your influence, Miss Trevennon, I
have been gradually undergoing certain changes
in my points of view. I am getting an insight
into your social basis and system, and, stubborn
Yankee as I am, I must admit that there&#8217;s
something fine in it. I really think I begin to
feel myself veering perceptibly. Until I met
you, I had no idea what a difference there was
between the Northern and Southern ideas of
these matters.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>&#8220;But I must not be taken as a strict representative
of the Southern idea&mdash;nor you, I suppose,
for a strict representative of the Northern
idea,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;At home, they
think me a great radical. I have no special
respect for pedigrees in general. That one&#8217;s
forefathers should have been honest is the first
thing, it seems to me, and that they should
have been social luminaries should come a
long way after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You rather amaze me in that,&#8221; said Louis.
&#8220;I thought there were no sticklers for birth and
ancestry like the Southerners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfectly true of a large class of them,&#8221;
said Margaret; &#8220;but I have seen too much of the
degeneration of distinguished families in the
South, to have much sympathy with that idea.
In too many cases they have lacked the spirit
to save them from such degeneration, and, that
being the case, what does their blood go for?
It ought to go for nothing, I think&mdash;worse than
nothing, for if it has any virtue at all, it should
make its possessors independent and manly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>&#8220;You have sometimes sneered a little gentle
sneer at the Gaston pride&mdash;have you not?&#8221;
said Louis; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve sometimes thought it
odd, because I had always been told that the
pride of the Southern people is unprecedented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of a different sort,&#8221; said Margaret;
&#8220;for instance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But she checked herself, and colored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pray give me the example,&#8221; said Louis,
earnestly. &#8220;Illustrations are such helps. I
beg you will not let any over-sensibility prevent
your speaking plainly. It may be that you&#8217;ve
got the best of these social questions. I want
to be able to judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How honest and fair you are!&#8221; said Margaret,
&#8220;and how rare that spirit is! I really
think I&#8217;ll tell you frankly what I was going to
say. You know what an appreciation of your
brother I have, and how entirely his fine qualities
command my respect, but I will not deny
that his bearing in the matter of this invitation
has amazed me. I think I am safe in saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
that no Southern man, in your brother&#8217;s sphere
of society, could possibly be found&mdash;no matter
how insulated or behind the times he might be&mdash;no
matter how poor or incapable or ignorant,
who could be agitated and flattered by an
invitation from General Morton or General
anybody else. The notion would never penetrate
their brains. But I am very bold,&#8221; she
said, checking herself suddenly. &#8220;I am afraid
I have said too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be too much for any one else
to say to me certainly,&#8221; said Louis, looking
steadily at her, &#8220;and I cannot say the
idea you suggest is exactly palatable; but I
think I could hardly take offence at words of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the door-bell rang, and presently
Thomas announced General Reardon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generals seem to be the order of the day,&#8221;
said Margaret, with a smile, as the visitor was
crossing the hall. &#8220;I might be back in Bassett
for the prevalence of titles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Trevennon greeted General Reardon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
with great cordiality, and set herself at once
to the task of entertaining him. He called
only occasionally at the Gastons&#8217; house, as he
did not enjoy their society any more than they
did his. He had been in the United States
Army before the war, and had been extremely
popular among the officers, being possessed of
a fund of anecdote and humor, which congealed
instantly in the atmosphere of the Gastons&#8217;
drawing-room, but flowed freely enough in
camps and barracks. He was of a good Southern
family, and essentially a gentleman. His
visits, as has been indicated, were not especially
inspiring to the Gastons, but Cousin Eugenia
had detected in her husband a faint
tendency to slight this distant cousin of hers,
and it was just like her, after that, to treat him
with greater distinction. General Gaston, in
truth, found it a little difficult to ignore the
fact that he was an officer in the Federal army
who had gone with the South, and certainly
did not enjoy his visits; but he stood in some
awe of his wife, which enabled him partially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
to conceal the fact that he chafed under her
cousin&#8217;s companionship.</p>

<p>When Thomas had summoned his master and
mistress to the drawing-room, Mrs. Gaston
seated herself near General Reardon, and
at once fell into fluent conversation with him.
General Gaston, for his part, established himself
half-way between this couple and the pair
who were seated on the other side of the fire-place.
He sat very straight and erect in his
chair, occasionally making a rather forced
remark to General Reardon, who, in his turn,
was conscious of being bored and ill at ease,
but entirely unconscious of being the object
of any slight whatever. It occurred to him,
perhaps, that his host&#8217;s manner was peculiar,
even unfortunate, but it would have taken a
great deal to convey to his honest breast the
suspicion that any gentleman alive could mean
to slight a visitor in his own house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston, when she chose, could talk
agreeably to any one on almost any subject, and
she was now discussing crops and market-gardening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and listening, with great vivacity of
expression, to a detailed account that General
Reardon was giving of the reports his wife&mdash;whom
he called &#8220;Loose,&#8221; her name being Lucy&mdash;related
of the result of a little venture in the
way of a market-garden which they had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;By-the-way, General,&#8221; said the visitor,
breaking off suddenly from his conversation
with Mrs. Gaston, and turning to address her
husband, as if struck with a sudden thought;
&#8220;are you invited to this supper of General
Morton&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>Imperceptible bristles began to rise over
General Gaston&#8217;s surface. He drew himself
still more erect, and cleared his throat once or
twice before answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;ah&mdash;yes,&#8221; said
General Gaston, with an inflection that suggested
that he was rather asking a question
than answering one. He cleared his throat
again and went on, with a certain superciliousness
that Margaret noted carefully. &#8220;General
Morton has been kind enough to remember me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and send me a card. There is always a very
distinguished company at these suppers of
his, and I shouldn&#8217;t think of missing this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loose wants me to go,&#8221; responded General
Reardon, in indolent, indifferent tones that set
Margaret&#8217;s blood a-tingling with delight; &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t care anything about it. I s&#8217;pose the
men&#8217;ll all wear swallow-tails, and I haven&#8217;t got
one. I&#8217;ll tell Morton he&#8217;ll have to let me off.&mdash;What
I was going to tell you about the potato
crop, is this,&#8221; he said, returning to his conversation
with Mrs. Gaston, as being the more
interesting of the two. &#8220;Loose says, if we&#8217;d
planted Early Rose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Margaret listened no further. She knew
Louis was looking at her, and she had drawn
down the corners of her mouth, demurely, in
her efforts not to laugh; but her eyes brimmed
over with such sparkling merriment, that the
mouth&#8217;s quiescence went for little.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston presently drew out his watch,
and reminded Miss Trevennon of the fact that
it was nearly time to set out for the theatre, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
fulfilment of their engagement, so she excused
herself, and went to put on her wraps.</p>

<p>When the two young people found themselves
alone together, in the clear, bracing atmosphere
of the city streets&mdash;they had chosen
to walk&mdash;Margaret began the conversation by
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Alan Decourcy called while we were out
driving this morning. I hope we shall not happen
to be in view of the theatre-party to night;
it would be a little awkward, as we both refused
to join it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Louis, &#8220;they need never
know but that our engagement antedated their
invitation. Don&#8217;t give yourself any uneasiness
about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had gone on a few moments in
silence, Louis said in his pleasant voice, which
even in the darkness indicated that he was
smiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you had your little triumph this
evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; returned Margaret, with a soft, little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
laugh, &#8220;and I must say I enjoyed it. But I
was wondering how he happened to know General
Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dare say they were chums in the
United States Army, before the war,&#8221; said
Louis. &#8220;Only think what a chance that man
threw away! Why, if he had remained in the
Union army he might have been a Major-General
by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a Major-General, I think,&#8221; said Margaret,
demurely; &#8220;or is it only a Brigadier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You impertinent little rebel!&#8221; said Louis.
&#8220;How dare you say that to me? How do you
know I will submit to such audacity? You
make heavy draughts upon my clemency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I do,&#8221; said Margaret; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
always had them generously honored. But
while we are on the subject, there&#8217;s one thing
that I do want to say to you. Do you know, I
have observed that your brother never gives
General Reardon his title? In speaking of
him to me or Cousin Eugenia, he always says
&#8216;your cousin,&#8217; and in speaking to him he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
avoids calling him anything at all. Once only,
when he had to say something, he called him
&#8216;Mr. Reardon.&#8217; He did indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in point of fact, you know,&#8221; said
Louis, rather uncomfortably, &#8220;he&#8217;s got no
more right to the title of General than you
have. The point has been definitely decided.
It is only a matter of courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who had the power to decide
it,&#8221; Margaret said; &#8220;but we are not considering
the point of legal right. Its being, as you
admit, a matter of courtesy, should settle the
thing, I think. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do. I&#8217;m not sure I always
thought so, but I do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the theatre, they found
the overture just begun. A few minutes later
they saw Mrs. Vere&#8217;s party enter and place
themselves in their box. The dashing young
hostess led the way, and seated herself <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>,
with a brilliant party grouped about her.
One or two of these Margaret recognized, and
Louis knew them all, naming them, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
comment, to Margaret. There was some one
whom they did not see, sitting in the shadow
behind the curtain, and to this person Mrs.
Vere directed a greater part of her attention.
She constantly leaned to speak to him, or
bowed her head to catch his utterances, casting
toward him now and then the languishing
looks which her peculiarly long eyelashes
rendered so effective. Margaret felt that this
person was Alan Decourcy, and at the end of
the first act her suspicion was proved to be correct,
as he then rose and came to Mrs. Vere&#8217;s
side to take a survey of the house. He looked
very graceful and elegant, but, in some way, the
great charm his appearance had once possessed
for her was gone.</p>

<p>When she turned her eyes away from him,
they rested, almost without any volition of her
own, upon Louis Gaston&#8217;s quiet profile. He
was looking away from her, and so she could
scan at leisure the earnest lineaments that had
in them a genuineness and nobleness so much
better than beauty. The more she felt her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
disappointment in Alan Decourcy, the more
she believed in and rested upon Louis Gaston&#8217;s
friendship. Imperceptibly her regard
for him had widened and deepened, until now
merely to think of him was to feel peaceful and
safe and at rest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS Day was fine and brilliant, and
Margaret awaked early. Her first thoughts
were of home and distant friends. How well
she knew that the dear father and mother, far
away in Bassett, were thinking of her! As she
rose and dressed, her heart was in full unison
with the day&#8217;s sweet lesson of peace and goodwill,
and when she knelt to say her morning
prayers, she had a vague feeling that somehow
this Christmas Day was a fuller and better one
than any she had known before. She did not
ask herself what was the new element in her
life that made it so; it was too indefinite to
be formulated into a tangible idea, but she felt
conscious of its presence.</p>

<p>General and Mrs. Gaston had a charming
present for her when she went down to breakfast&mdash;a
pair of exquisite gold bracelets of the
most beautiful design and workmanship, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
as they seemed really pleased with the little
presents that she had prepared for them, they
had a very satisfactory beginning of their
Christmas Day. After breakfast, she went to
her room to write a letter home, and when
that was done it was time to dress for church.</p>

<p>A little before eleven, as Miss Trevennon was
standing in the deep bow-window of the drawing-room,
equipped for the morning service,
she heard a firm tread on the carpet behind
her, and the next moment her somewhat rusty
little Prayer-book and Hymnal were slipped
from her hand, and a marvellous tortoise-shell
case, containing two beautiful little books, substituted
for them. Margaret looked up quickly,
and met Louis Gaston&#8217;s smiling eyes. He had
searched New York over for the prettiest set
he could find, and the result satisfied him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will use these instead, will you not?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I wanted to give you some little
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure rose to Margaret&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw anything half so lovely,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
said, handling them delightedly. &#8220;To think
of your taking the trouble! I suspect my
shabby little books offended your fastidious
taste. I never dreamed of your remembering
me in this kind way. I wish I had a present
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might give me the old ones, perhaps,&#8221;
he said, hesitatingly. &#8220;I should think it a
munificent return, for, as you say, they are worn
and shabby, and that comes only from much
using. How often they have been in your
hands when your thoughts were away with
God! I should like to keep them as a souvenir
of you. May I, if you don&#8217;t particularly
value them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be only too glad for you to have
them,&#8221; said Margaret, in a low voice. &#8220;Only I
did not think you would care for anything like
that. I asked Cousin Eugenia once what
church your family belonged to, and she said
you called yourselves Unitarians, but practically
you were pagans. I couldn&#8217;t help hoping
it was not really true&mdash;of you at least.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t in the least true of me,&#8221; he said,
frowning, and looking so displeased that Margaret
was almost sorry she had spoken. &#8220;I
would not, for anything, have you to suppose
me an irreligious man, for it is not true, and
I never even called myself a Unitarian. On
the contrary, I was wishing a little while ago
that I could go with you to church, so that you
and I might keep this day holy together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Margaret, earnestly. &#8220;I have
seen that you do not very often go. Go with
us to-day, and make a resolve for better things
in future. You would be so wise to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I will go this morning,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;Eugenia has not room for me in the
coup&eacute;. But will you let me take you to-night?
We will walk, perhaps, if it remains fine, and
the music will be lovely. Perhaps, if we&#8217;re
lucky, they will get some good voice to sing
the <i>Cantique de No&euml;l</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love that so dearly,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;I
shall be delighted to go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little sigh rose, as she spoke. This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
one of Charley Somers&#8217; favorites; she had
taken pains to see that he sang it correctly,
and his voice was trained to it beautifully.</p>

<p>Her reflections were cut short by the appearance
of Mrs. Gaston, who swept down the steps,
elaborately arrayed in furs and velvets, and
signified her readiness to set out.</p>

<p>Louis helped them into the carriage, and
then turned away, saying he was going for a
long walk. There was a look of gravity on his
face that Margaret found herself recalling long
afterward.</p>

<p>The weather continued fine, and it proved
quite mild enough for Louis and Margaret to
walk to church in the evening. As they took
their way along the gayly lighted streets, the
young man turned suddenly and, looking down
into her face, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, I found a little pressed
flower in my Hymnal, when I opened it this
morning. Am I to keep it or return it to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were just under a gas-light, and Margaret,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
though she would not drop her eyes under
his searching gaze, felt that she looked confused,
as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you must give that back to me. I had
forgotten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a little flower that Charley Somers
had put in there one evening, and she had
never happened to remove it.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston put his hand into his pocket and
took out the book. It opened easily at the
place, and he removed the flower, which was
run into a little slit, and handed it to her as
they entered the church vestibule.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were some initials under it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can just rub those out. It doesn&#8217;t
matter,&#8221; said Margaret, as she took the flower.
She was about to crush and throw it from her,
when a pang of pity for poor Charley checked
her; so she opened her own Prayer-book and
hurriedly slipped it among the leaves.</p>

<p>The service seemed wonderfully sweet to
her that night. The hymns and anthems were
triumphant and inspiring, and the sermon was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
simple, earnest and comforting. Louis found
his places, and used his little book sedulously,
and Margaret felt intuitively that this service
was sweet to him also. As she glanced at
him occasionally, she saw that his face looked
serious and a little careworn, now that she saw
it in such perfect repose.</p>

<p>The sermon was ended now. The congregation
had risen at its termination, and had
settled again in their seats. The wardens
were walking up the aisle to receive the alms-basins,
when the organ began to murmur a
low prelude. Louis and Margaret glanced at
each other quickly. It was the <i>Cantique de
No&euml;l</i>.</p>

<p>Margaret leaned back in her seat, serene and
restful, prepared for a deep enjoyment of the
pleasure before her, and at that moment a rich,
sweet voice, high up in the choir behind her
began:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Oh, holy night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At the first note uttered by that voice the
color rushed to Miss Trevennon&#8217;s cheeks, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
she drew in her breath with a sound that was
almost a gasp.</p>

<p>And up on high the beautiful voice sang on:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;It is the night of the dear Saviour&#8217;s birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higher and sweeter it soared&mdash;thrilling, rich,
pathetic&mdash;and how familiar to the young girl&#8217;s
ears was every modulation and inflection!
How often had that flood of melody been
poured forth, for her ear alone, in the old
parlor at home!</p>

<p>It was Charley Somers, and she knew that he
had seen her, and that he was singing to her
now, no less than then. She listened, as in a
dream, while the wistful, yearning voice sang
on. And now came the words:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Fall on your knees! fall on your knees!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were somewhat indistinct, in their
mingling of sweet sounds, and, in some vague
way, it seemed to Margaret that they were a
direct appeal from Charley Somers to her for
mercy and pardon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>It was all so moving, and Gaston felt so
touched by it himself, that it scarcely surprised
him when he glanced at Margaret, as
the sweet voice died away, to see that her eyes
were full of tears. As they knelt for the concluding
prayer she brushed away the traces
of these, and when they walked down the aisle
together her calmness had quite returned.
And how calm and quiet her companion
looked! His perfectly chosen clothes, the
smooth neatness of his short, dark hair, and,
more than all, his self-collected bearing and
thoughtful face, made him a contrast to the
rather carelessly dressed young man, with
dishevelled, curly locks, and eager, restless
eyes, who stood in the vestibule, at the foot of
the gallery steps, rapidly scanning the faces of
the dispersing congregation, in complete unconsciousness
of the fact that his somewhat
singular conduct and appearance were being
observed by those around him. As his restless
gaze at last fell upon Miss Trevennon, his knit
brows relaxed, and he pressed forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>&#8220;May I come to see you to-morrow?&#8221; he
said, in eager tones, which, though low, were
distinctly audible to Louis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Margaret at once, in a somewhat
tremulous voice, &#8220;at eleven in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, taking her companion&#8217;s arm, she
passed on. Louis had observed that the two
did not shake hands, nor exchange any word
of greeting. This hurried question and answer
was all that passed between them. What had
there been in a short, casual meeting like that
to make the girl look pale and excited, as her
companion saw by a furtive glance that she
was? He could feel her hand tremble slightly
when she first laid it within his arm, but the
little, almost imperceptible flutter soon ceased,
and she walked on very quiet and still. And
so they took their way along the streets in
silence. She did not seem inclined to talk,
and he would not jar her by speaking.</p>

<p>Margaret, as she mused upon this meeting,
was blaming herself for the concession she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
had made, which was indeed attributable altogether
to the music.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no resolution or power of resistance
whatever, when I&#8217;m under the influence
of music,&#8221; she said to herself, half angrily.
&#8220;It takes away my moral accountability. I
don&#8217;t believe the story of the sirens is a fable.
A beautiful voice could draw me toward itself
as truly as the pole draws the magnet. It is
intense weakness. I ought to have told him
No, and ended the matter at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remembering that her companion would
have reason to wonder at her silence, Margaret
roused herself with an effort and made some
comment on the service.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all very beautiful,&#8221; said Louis. &#8220;I
felt it very much, and I feel very happy to
have gone. That solo was exquisitely sung.
The voice does not seem to be highly cultivated,
but it was thrillingly sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Mr. Somers, the young man from
Bassett, whose voice I have spoken to you
of. He has just come to Washington, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
knew he would want to see me, so I named an
hour when I was sure to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had reached home and were
going up the steps, they found Thomas opening
the door for a colored servant-man, who
had two small parcels in his hand. He took
off his hat and stepped back as they came up,
and Thomas said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a parcel for Miss Trevennon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret turned and held out her hand for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where from?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the Arlington, Miss,&#8221; replied the
man, in evident trepidation. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry,
Miss, but there&#8217;s been a mistake. It was to
have been sent this morning, but it has been
such a busy day that it has been forgotten.
Mr. Decourcy left particular orders, and I hope
you&#8217;ll be kind enough to excuse the delay,
Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret turned the parcel so as to get the
light from the hall gas upon it. As she did so,
her expression changed quickly. It was addressed
to Mrs. Vere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>&#8220;There is some mistake,&#8221; she said, coldly,
with a certain high turn of the head that Louis
knew. &#8220;This is not for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor negro, who was perhaps somewhat
the worse for the wine remnants left by the
Arlington&#8217;s Christmas guests, was overwhelmed
with confusion, and, quickly extending the
other package, explained that he had made a
mistake between the two, and asked Miss Trevennon
rather helplessly to see if this one was
not addressed to herself.</p>

<p>It proved to be so; and though, under the
circumstances, Margaret would have preferred
not to touch it, she was compelled to take it
and dismiss the man, which she did somewhat
curtly.</p>

<p>She did not examine her parcel until she
reached her own room, and even then she
tossed it on the bed, and removed her wraps
and hat and put them away before she untied
the string which bound it. Once she thought
she would put it out of sight until to-morrow,
but, despite her disfavor toward the giver, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
had a young lady&#8217;s natural curiosity as to the
gift, and so she presently took it up and untied
it. A little note fell out. It was dated Christmas
morning at nine, and ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I am just leaving for Baltimore, under a
pledge to spend to-day with Amy and the
children. I have been more than disappointed&mdash;<i>hurt</i>
at missing you, both when I called
and at the theatre last evening. I did not
know you had been present, until I heard it by
accident, after we had left. It had not at all
entered into my calculations to forego the
pleasure of taking leave of you in person, and
I propose to get the better of fate by returning
in a day or two for this purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas, dear Daisy, and all good
wishes for the coming year! Who knows what
it may have in store for us?</p>

<p>&#8220;Wear my little present sometimes for the
sake of yours devotedly, A. D.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;So much for note number one!&#8221; said Margaret.
&#8220;It would be interesting to have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
glance at note number two, which I have no
doubt is equally tender and gracious.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took up the little leather case and opened
it, revealing a beautiful locket. In spite
of herself, she could not withhold a tribute
to her cousin&#8217;s taste. The workmanship and
design of this little ornament were so effective
and so uncommon that she felt sure Alan must
have gone to some trouble about it, and most
likely had it made expressly for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> kind,&#8221; she said, regretfully. &#8220;It <i>was</i>
good of him to go back to Baltimore, in order
that Amy and the children should not be disappointed.
I almost wish I had not made this
new discovery about him; but no, no, no! It
would have been dreadful to be ignorant of
the real truth of the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>It occurred to her now to open the locket
and, on doing so, her cousin&#8217;s high-bred face
looked out. The very sight of it made her recoil
inwardly. How well she remembered the
look of these same eyes, as they had been bent
upon Mrs. Vere, with an expression she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
have liked to forget. What right had he to
expect her to wear his picture? Why should
she?</p>

<p>He had sent another note and another present
elsewhere. Was there another picture,
which some one else had been gracefully urged
to wear, for the sake of hers devotedly? It
was more than probable!</p>

<p>&#8220;I half believe I begin to understand him,&#8221;
she said to herself, indignantly. &#8220;It is one of
his sage and correct opinions that a man
should marry, but all the same a man wants
his little diversions. Under these circumstances
he had better marry an amiable, easy-going
young thing, who is healthy and cheerful,
who knows nothing of the world, and who
will leave him to pursue his little diversions
undisturbed. It is perfectly humiliating! I
will return his locket, for the very sight of it
would always sting me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. SOMERS came promptly at eleven, the
next morning, and Margaret received him
in the drawing-room alone. She had given orders
that she should be denied to any early visitors
who might be coming in, and was resolved
that she would be just and patient with the
young man, though she was also resolved that
the nature of their relationship should be
definitely settled and understood, during this
interview.</p>

<p>They had not been seated long when Margaret
heard Louis Gaston&#8217;s voice speaking to
a servant in the hall. She looked up in surprise,
as she had supposed him to be at his
office an hour ago. He came in, with his overcoat
on, and his hat in his hand, and when
Margaret presented him to Mr. Somers he cordially
offered him his disengaged hand. Margaret
was struck with the contrast between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
two general exteriors, as she had been the
night before, but she was not a whit ashamed
of her old friend. She told herself that no
man with eyes in his head could fail to see
that Somers was a gentleman, and, for the rest,
it did not matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned from my sister-in-law,&#8221; said
Louis, addressing Mr. Somers, &#8220;that Miss
Trevennon was receiving a visit from a friend
from home; and Mrs. Gaston has authorized
me to come and engage you for dinner to-day,
if you have no other appointment. I hope you
will be able to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret, glancing at Mr. Somers, was distressed
to see that he looked decidedly ungracious.
She saw, by his manner, that he
suspected that this smooth-spoken Yankee was
going to patronize him, though nothing could
have been franker and less patronizing than
Gaston&#8217;s whole bearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Mr. Somers answered, rather
curtly, &#8220;I have another engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Louis expressed the hope that he would give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
them another day while he was in Washington,
and asked for his address, saying that he would
call upon him.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, having a hazy impression that
to hand his card was the proper thing, and not
wishing to be outdone in <i>savoir-faire</i>, fumbled
in his pocket and produced a tumbled envelope,
out of which he drew a visiting-card of imposing
proportions. Margaret glanced at it quickly,
and saw, to her horror, that it was printed!
In the midst of a wide expanse of tinted pasteboard
was inscribed <i>C. R. Somers</i>, in aggressive
German type. She smiled to herself, as she
made a swift mental comparison between this
card and another&mdash;a pure-white little affair,
with <i>Mr. Louis Gaston</i> engraved on it in quiet
script. She knew well what Gaston was thinking
of Charley, as he waited quietly while
the latter wrote his address and handed him
the cumbrous card with rather a bad grace,
and she knew as well what Charley, as he
scribbled off the street, and number of his
friend&#8217;s house, was thinking of Mr. Gaston. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
was all very absurd, and she could not help
feeling and perhaps looking amused.</p>

<p>Louis lingered to make a few more friendly
overtures, but these were so loftily received
by Mr. Somers that he soon found it best to
take leave, and, with a pleasant &#8220;<i>Au revoir</i>&#8221; to
both, he turned and left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;A French-talking, phrase-turning dandy!&#8221;
said Charley, as soon as his back was turned.
&#8220;I wonder that you can tolerate such a man,
Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be interesting to ascertain his
opinion of you,&#8221; returned Margaret. &#8220;If he
puts no higher estimate on your conduct on
this occasion than I do, perhaps it is as well
for us to remain in ignorance of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you suppose I care one penny for
his opinion? If you do, you are much mistaken.
I was obliged to give my address when
he asked for it, but I hope he&#8217;ll not trouble
himself to call. I have no desire to improve
his acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you might find it not only pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
but profitable,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;There
are many things that you might, with great
benefit, learn from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word, Margaret, this is a little
too much,&#8221; exclaimed Somers. &#8220;You have
abandoned and repudiated your own people in
a very short while, when you can talk of my
learning from a conceited Yankee fop like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve advised you to
take lessons from the Yankees,&#8221; said Margaret;
&#8220;and as to Mr. Gaston&#8217;s being conceited,
I really think he&#8217;s less so than you are, Charley,
though he knows much more. As to his
being a Yankee&mdash;well, yes, he is a Yankee, as
we should say, and he&#8217;s a very capable and
accomplished one. And as to the third point,
of his being a dandy, you know very well he is
simply a remarkably well-dressed man, whose
appearance in your heart you admire, in spite
of your tall talking. But what&#8217;s the use of all
this? It isn&#8217;t dress, nor nationality, nor deportment
even, that makes the man. Superficially,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
you two are very unlike, but I think
the discrepancy as to your real natures is by
no means so great. You are a pair of true and
honorable gentlemen at heart&mdash;at least, I believe
Mr. Gaston to be such, and I know you
are, Charley.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke in a tone of great gentleness for
she knew that, before this interview ended, she
must say words which would bruise his poor
heart cruelly, and it was a kind and honest
heart, which had long cherished for her a true
and steadfast devotion By degrees she led
him on to a quieter mood, and spoke to him
gravely and earnestly of their future lives&mdash;his
and hers&mdash;which, as she gently tried to show
him, must needs lie apart. He had heard her
utter these sad words before, but there was a
difference&mdash;an absolute resolve in looks and
tones that compelled him to realize that this
time they were final. And yet she had never
been so gentle and so kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think too highly of you, Charley,&#8221; she
said, when their interview was drawing to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
close, &#8220;to believe that you will let this feeling
for me ruin your life. There is so much a
man may do! The very thought of it is tantalizing
to a woman sometimes. Oh, Charley, be
in earnest. It is all you lack. Do something&mdash;no
matter what, so it is <i>work</i>, and do it faithfully
and well. I think that, in itself, would
make you almost happy. But don&#8217;t think
about happiness. Indeed, I think that does
not signify so very much. Think only of filling
your place in the world and doing your duty to
God and man, and happiness will come of
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she sent him from her at last, the
hope which had until now lived in his bosom
was quite, quite dead, never to revive again;
and yet, with the relinquishment of that hope,
a new life seemed to spring up within him,
which made him resolve, before he left her
presence, that he would win her approval
though he could never win her love. He
knew he could not feel that he had ever possessed
her entire approbation, and it was well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
worth striving for&mdash;better, he said to himself,
as many another good man has said, in those
first moments of sad renunciation, than another
woman&#8217;s love.</p>

<p>That evening Charley Somers formed a sudden
resolution. He would not go back to the
South and the old stagnating life, which had
already made its sad impress upon his mind
and character. He would set out at once to
South America, to join some resolute fellows
who were friends of his, who had gone to seek
their fortunes, and had often urged him to
come to them. He did not see Margaret again,
but wrote her a manly note of farewell, over
which she shed tears enough to have recalled
him from the ends of the earth, if, by ill-luck,
he could have seen them.</p>

<p>It happened that Louis Gaston, chancing to
meet her on her way to her room with this letter,
which she had just been reading, open in
her hand, saw her tearful eyes and pale, distressed
face; he further noted traces of weeping
that would have escaped a superficial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
observer, when she appeared at dinner an hour
later. He could not help associating these
signs with Mr. Somers, and when he took
occasion to mention the latter&#8217;s name, in
speaking to Mrs. Gaston after dinner, he was
scarcely surprised when she informed him
that she had heard, through Margaret, that
Mr. Somers had already left for South America,
to be gone indefinitely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He goes to seek his fortune,&#8221; said Mrs.
Gaston; &#8220;therefore I say his return is indefinite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he finds it,&#8221; said Louis Gaston to
himself, &#8220;and the girl he loves consents to
share it with him, a man might well envy him.
And if she consents not, what will the fortune
avail him? It may be that she has already
consented! Most likely the sweet pledge has
been given, and he goes to seek his fortune
with the knowledge that her hopes and fears
are entwined about him. What mightn&#8217;t a man
accomplish with such a reward as his in
view?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>These reflections passed through his mind,
as he sat quietly on one side of the room
watching Miss Trevennon as she sat talking to
his brother, only her fair, sweet profile turned
toward him, and a slightly distressed look on
her face, which his searching eyes alone discovered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp;FEW days after Christmas, as Margaret
was in her room, writing one of her frequent
long letters home, Mr. Decourcy&#8217;s card
was brought to her. It was with a strong feeling
of reluctance that she went down to him,
and she stopped at Mrs. Gaston&#8217;s door, hoping
her cousin would accompany her. Mrs. Gaston,
however, was lying on the lounge, reading
a novel, and she declared herself to be too tired
to stir; so Margaret was obliged to go down
alone.</p>

<p>After her first impulse had died away, she
had concluded to keep the locket, as she felt
she had no reason to take so extreme a step as
to return it. Nothing, however, would induce
her to wear Alan Decourcy&#8217;s picture, and that
she meant to let him know.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Margaret had
spoken to her cousin since witnessing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
scene with Mrs. Vere in the conservatory, and
the recollection of that scene necessarily
threw a certain amount of constraint into her
manner.</p>

<p>Not observing this, however, Mr. Decourcy
came toward her, with some words of ardent
greeting, and when she extended her hand he
made a motion to raise it to his lips. With a
movement that was almost rough in its suddenness,
Margaret snatched her hand away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret! What can this mean?&#8221; said
Decourcy, in a tone of surprised reproach.</p>

<p>Miss Trevennon gave a little, constrained
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that sort of thing,&#8221; she said,
lightly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it again. It&#8217;s unpleasant
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he answered, with the utmost
gentleness, untinged by any shade of pique.
&#8220;I beg your pardon. I am very sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind! It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said
Margaret, hurriedly. &#8220;Thank you so much
for the locket, Alan. It is lovely&mdash;far lovelier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
than I have any idea of, I dare say, for I am
so ignorant about such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped it would please you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You saw the picture I ventured to put in it?
And will you consent to wear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; she said, somewhat
uneasily. &#8220;It was very kind of you to
put it in, but I never have worn any one&#8217;s
picture. I know you&#8217;re a cousin, and all that,
but I think, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll take the
picture out and put it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he interrupted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t because I am your cousin, Margaret,
that I want you to wear my picture,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;On the contrary, I hope for the time
when you will forget that relationship in a
nearer and tenderer one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alan! Stop. You must not go on,&#8221; said
Margaret, with sudden vehemence. &#8220;There
can be no thought of a nearer relationship between
us at any time. If we are to be friends
at all, this subject must not be mentioned
again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>&#8220;Forgive me; I have startled you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I meant not to do that. I do not want to
constrain you or to force this hope of mine
upon you too suddenly, but I cannot lightly
give it up. It has been with me, during all my
wanderings to and fro&mdash;if not the definite hope,
at least an appreciation of the fact that my
sweet cousin was endowed, more than any woman
whom I had known, with all the attributes
and qualities a man could desire in his companion
for life. I cannot, even yet, quite
abandon the hope that I may yet induce you
to accept my devotion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret might have borne the rest, but this
word galled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devotion!&#8221; she said mockingly, with a
little scornful laugh. &#8220;Oh, Alan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Why should you
speak to me in that tone? It is unfair, Margaret.
It is not like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; she said, growing grave, and
speaking with a sudden, earnest vehemence,
&#8220;that you degrade the word devotion, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
you call the feeling you have to offer me by
that name. I know too well what real devotion
means. I have too just an estimate of its
goodness and strength to call the cool regard
you have for me devotion! A cool regard between
cousins does well enough, but that feeling
in connection with marriage is another
thing, and I had better tell you, here and now,
that I would live my life out unloved and
alone, sooner than I would wrong myself by
accepting such a counterfeit devotion as this
that you offer me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Decourcy, who was, of course, entirely ignorant
of the ground on which Margaret&#8217;s strong
feeling was based, heard her with amazement.
The only explanation that suggested itself was
that some one, who happened to be aware of
his rather well-known affair with Mrs. Vere,
had informed his cousin. It was, therefore,
with a tone of injured gentleness, that he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret, you surprise and grieve me inexpressibly
by such words as those. I can only
account for them by the possibility of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
one&#8217;s having given you false ideas about me.
There are always people to do these things,
unfortunately,&#8221; he went on, with a little sigh
of patient resignation; &#8220;but you should have
hesitated before believing a story to my disadvantage.
I would have been more just to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been no story told,&#8221; said Margaret.
&#8220;If there were any stories to tell, they
have been kept from me. Do not let us pursue
this topic, Alan, and when we drop it now, let
it be forever. It is quite out of the question
that we can ever be more to each other than
we are now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have said it,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;my only
course is a silent acquiescence. Painful and
disappointing as such a decision is to me, since
it is your decision I have no word to say
against it. But with regard to the lightness
and insincerity you have charged me with, I
have a right to speak and I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reassured by Margaret&#8217;s assertion that no
one had maligned him to her, he felt strong to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
defend himself, and it was, therefore, in the
most urgent tone that he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel it hard, Margaret, very hard, that you
should harbor such opinions of me, when my
thoughts of you have been all tenderness and
trust. Was it not enough that you should deprive
me, at one blow, of the hope that I have
cherished as my dearest wish for the future,
without adding to the bitterness of that disappointment,
the still keener one of feeling that
I must endure your contempt?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no doubt of his earnestness now.
He was fired by a genuine interest, and he
longed to recover the good opinion of this
spirited, high-souled girl more than he had
longed for anything for years.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were never unreasonable, Margaret,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;and therefore I feel sure I may
rely upon you to give me your reasons for this
change toward me&mdash;for you will not deny that
you are changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why talk about it, Alan? I like you very
well. I suppose you&#8217;re as much to be believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
in as other men. The mistake I made was in
supposing you to be superior to them. You
would not like the idea of being on a pedestal,
I know; so be content, and let us say no more
about the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, if I cannot consent,&#8221; he answered,
gravely. &#8220;It is no light matter to me
to lose your regard; and when you remember
that I have long hoped to make you my wife,
some day, I think you will feel that that fact
creates an indebtedness on your part to me,
and gives me the right to demand an explanation
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone of conscious rectitude and the reproachful
sadness of the eyes he turned upon
her, made Margaret so indignant and angry
that she said, with some heat:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are playing a farce, Alan, and it had
better come to an end. I am perfectly willing
to accord you all the credit you deserve. You
are a charming man of the world,&#8221; she added,
falling into a lighter tone, &#8220;and I admire your
manners immensely. I am perfectly willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
to continue to be on good terms with you,
but there must be certain limitations to our
friendship. I could not consent to a return
to the old intimacy, and you must not expect
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; he said, urgently. &#8220;I insist
that you tell me. Margaret, remember how
important this is to me; remember how I
love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And in a certain way his words were true.
He felt himself, at this moment, really in love.
Now that he found himself likely to lose her,
this handsome, spirited, honest-hearted girl,
grew inestimably more dear to him. He longed
to be able to control her&mdash;to settle it, then and
there, that she was to be his own. So it was
with the fire of real feeling in his eyes that he
drew nearer and eagerly sought her averted
gaze, and even ventured to take her hand.
But the moment she met that look, and felt
that touch, Margaret sprang to her feet and
half involuntarily took her position behind a
large chair, where she stood, resting upon its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
high back and looking at him with an expression
of defiant scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret,&#8221; he said, rising too, and bending
upon her again that eager look that galled her
so, &#8220;do you shrink from my mere look and
touch? There must be a reason for your
manner, and that reason I must and will
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall!&#8221; she answered, excitedly, unable
to bear his tone of injured superiority any
longer. &#8220;I witnessed a scene between you and
Mrs. Vere in the conservatory at the ball that
night, that made me despise you. It revealed
your true nature to me, at a glance, and I am
glad of it. I should not have spoken of it. I
could have managed to hold my peace and
meet you calmly as a casual acquaintance; but
that you would not have. But when you presume
to offer me what you are pleased to call
your devotion, with the memory of that scene
in my mind, I can be silent no longer. And
now,&#8221; she went on, after an instant&#8217;s pause, &#8220;I
have spoken, and we understand each other.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Let the whole subject be dropped just here,
forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had avoided looking at him, as she
spoke, and even now she hesitated to meet his
eyes. There was a moment&#8217;s deep stillness,
and then, to the relief of both, Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s
silken robes were heard sweeping
down the staircase.</p>

<p>She entered, and the room&#8217;s whole atmosphere
changed. Her graceful toilet, well-turned
phrases and studious correctness of demeanor,
recalled the usages of the world in
which they lived, and Margaret and Decourcy
resumed their seats and began to talk of snow-storms
and sleigh-rides, following Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s
lead.</p>

<p>When Margaret presently glanced at Mr.
Decourcy, she saw that he was very pale, but
that was all. He had never been more self-possessed.</p>

<p>When he rose to go, Mrs. Gaston, seeing that
something was amiss, discreetly walked over
to the window for a moment, and Decourcy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
taking a step toward Margaret, said in a low
tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very hard to me, Margaret,
and have judged me hastily. The time may
come when you will see that it is so, and for
that time I shall wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said good-bye then, without offering his
hand, and Margaret, to her amazement, found
herself feeling like a culprit. There was such
an air of gentle magnanimousness about Mr.
Decourcy, that it made her feel quite contrite.
In exciting which sensation Mr. Decourcy had
obtained exactly the result he had aimed at.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was two evenings prior to the day fixed for
Miss Trevennon&#8217;s return to her home. January,
with its multifarious engagements, had
passed, and February was well advanced. It
had been a very happy time to Margaret, and,
now that her visit was almost at an end, she
found herself much prone to reverie, and constantly
falling into quiet fits of musing. There
was much pleasant food for thought in looking
back, but an instinct constantly warned her
against looking forward.</p>

<p>On this particular evening, Miss Trevennon
and Louis Gaston were alone. Cousin Eugenia
had gone to her room, and General Gaston was
out. Margaret had observed that she quite
often found herself alone with Mr. Gaston
lately, and she even fancied sometimes that
Cousin Eugenia contrived to have it so. She
smiled to think of the multiplicity of Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Eugenia&#8217;s little man&#339;uvres, and the book she
had been reading fell to her lap. She glanced
toward Louis, sitting some little distance off
at the other side of the fire-place; but he was
quite lost to view behind the opened sheet of
the <i>Evening Star</i>. So Miss Trevennon fixed her
eyes on the fire, and fell into a fit of musing.</p>

<p>She was looking her best to-night. There
had been guests at dinner, and she was dressed
accordingly. Black suited her better than
anything else, and the costume of black silk
and lace which she wore now was exquisitely
becoming. Her rounded, slender arms were
bare, and a snowy patch of her lovely neck was
visible above the lace of her square corsage.
Her long black draperies fell richly away to
one side, over the Turkey rug, and as she
rested lightly on the angle of her little high
heel, with one foot, in its dainty casing of
black silk stocking and low-cut slipper, lightly
laid across the other, her graceful, easy attitude
and elegant toilet made her a striking figure,
apart from the distinguished beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
her face. Louis Gaston, who had noiselessly
lowered his paper, took in every detail of face,
figure, attitude and costume, with a sense of
keen appreciation, and, as he continued to
look, a sudden smile of merriment curved his
lips. Miss Trevennon, looking up, met this
smile, and smiled in answer to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she said. &#8220;What were you
thinking of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tell you?&#8221; he asked, still smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; please do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was recalling the fact that, when you first
arrived&mdash;before I had seen you&mdash;I used to
speak of you to Eugenia as &#8216;The Importation.&#8217;
It is no wonder that I smile now at
the remembrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very impertinent, undoubtedly,&#8221;
said Margaret; &#8220;but I won&#8217;t refuse to forgive
you, if you, in your turn, will agree to forgive
me my impertinences, which have been
many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be necessary to recall them first,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and that I am unable to do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>&#8220;I have been dictatorial and critical and
aggressive, and I have had no right to be any
of these. I have magnified my own people persistently,
in talking to you, and depreciated
yours. You mustn&#8217;t take me as a specimen of
Southern courtesy. Wait till you see my
father. I&#8217;m a degenerate daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I may see him some time. Knowing
you has made me wish to know your people
better. If I ask you, some day, to let me
come and make their acquaintance, what will
you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, and welcome,&#8221; said Margaret, heartily;
and then, as a consciousness of the warmth
of her tone dawned upon her, she added:
&#8220;We are a hospitable race, you know, and
hold it a sacred duty to entertain strangers.
But I fear you would find us disappointing in
a great many ways. In so many points, and
these very essential ones, we are inferior to
you. If only we could both get rid of our
prejudices! Just think what a people we
might be, if we were kneaded together, each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
willing to assimilate what is best in the other!
But I suppose that is a Utopian dream. As
far as my small observation goes, it seems to
me that we in the South see things on a
broader basis, and that a gentleman&#8217;s claim to
meet another gentleman on equal terms rests
upon something higher and stronger than trifling
technicalities such as using printed visiting-cards,
or calling a dress-coat &#8216;a swallow-tail,&#8217;
for instance!&#8221; she said, with twinkling
eyes. &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve had those two scores
against my compatriots on your mind. Now,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wipe them off instantly, if I have,&#8221;
he said, laughing. &#8220;I feel amiably disposed
to-night. I think it is the prospect of your
departure that has softened me. I hope you
are one little bit sorry to leave us. It would
be but a small return for the colossal regret
we feel at parting from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said, with her eyes fixed
on the fire&mdash;&#8220;very, very sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; he said quickly, not daring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
give voice to the delight with which her fervently
uttered admission filled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, really. You have all been so good to
me. I think General Gaston has even decided
to forgive me for being a Southerner, since I
could not possibly help it, which is a higher
tribute than the regard of Cousin Eugenia and
yourself, perhaps, as you had no prejudices to
overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have paid me the greatest possible
compliment,&#8221; said Louis. &#8220;I would rather
you should say that than anything, almost.
You must admit, however, that at one time you
would not have said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite true; but I think now that
I did you injustice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think you did. It was true at
one time that I was very prejudiced, and to a
certain extent it is true yet; but you&#8217;ve worked
wonders with me, Miss Trevennon. I do think
I see things more fairly than I did. I had a
great deal of hereditary and inherent prejudice
to overcome, and I think I have got rid of a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
portion of it, thanks to you! Who knows but,
if you could have kept me near you, you might
have reformed me yet? Of course, I should
not venture to criticise a decision of yours, but
when Eugenia urged you so, the other day, to
stay a month longer, do you know, I almost held
my breath to hear what you would say? And
your positive refusal quite cut me. It&#8217;s rather
hard on a man, to learn that his education is
to be cut short at one fell blow like that; and
I am in horrible fear of retrogression.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t laugh at me, Mr. Gaston,&#8221; said
Margaret, rather confusedly. &#8220;I am afraid I
must often have seemed to you conceited and
pert. I believe I am, a little. Even my dear
father tells me so, now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you love your home and your parents!&#8221;
said Louis, looking at her very gently.
&#8220;I have so often observed it. Is it a provincial
trait? I never saw a stronger feeling than the
one you have for your household gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do love them,&#8221; Margaret said; &#8220;and
I can give no stronger proof of it than that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s invitation does not tempt me
to remain longer away from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do they love you very much&mdash;or not?&#8221;
he asked, looking into her face and smiling
brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she answered, smiling too; &#8220;as if
I were perfection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost think you are,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I
said to myself, from the first, &#8216;She is well-named
Margaret, for she&#8217;s just a pearl.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Simply and quietly as he said it, there was
something in his tone that thrilled her with a
sudden emotion. She dared not raise her eyes
to his, and so she turned away her flushed face
as she answered, with an effort to speak as
usual:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am named for my mother. Papa calls me
Daisy, to distinguish us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that suits you almost as well,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Your feelings are so fresh&mdash;not a whiff
of their perfume brushed away yet. What a
thing it would be for one of the careworn,
weary worldlings one meets every day, to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
your heart in her bosom for just one hour!
And oh, what a revelation of falseness and hollowness
and envy it would be to you to see into
a heart like that! God protect you from it,
Margaret! I am almost glad that you are going
back to that quiet old country-place. It
gives me a pang merely to think of the possibility
of your being contaminated by the world.
I could not bear to face the thought that the
pearl might lose its pureness and the daisy
wither. I have tried that no one shall suspect
the fact, but you don&#8217;t know how I have
watched over you. It was presumptuous of
me, perhaps, but now that you know it, do you
forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Margaret! She made a brave struggle
for self-mastery, but it was only half successful.
Apart from his words, there was something
in his looks and tones that made what he
had said a revelation to her. There could be
but one meaning in those fervent, tender eyes,
and the sound of the caressing voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You once refused to shake hands with me,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Louis went on, presently. &#8220;Do you remember?
I was in disgrace then, but I can&#8217;t help
hoping I&#8217;m restored. Will you give me your
hand now, in token of full pardon for the
past?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had taken a seat very near to her, and
when he extended his hand she laid hers in
it, without moving from her place. He held it
close, for an instant, and then, stooping, laid
his lips upon it.</p>

<p>Margaret suffered the caress in silence.
She felt nerveless and irresponsible, but her
whole nature responded to these signs of tenderness
from him. She knew his heart was
seeking hers, which was ready to answer, at a
touch. She felt confused and tremulous, but
very happy and contented and safe, and when
she presently withdrew her hand from Louis&#8217;,
she gave him, in its stead, a look of the deepest
confidence and kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something I want to tell you,
Margaret&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, and while she was almost
holding her breath to listen, the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
General Gaston&#8217;s key was heard in the lock,
and, with a quick motion, they moved apart.</p>

<p>As Louis stood up and turned to meet his
brother, Margaret sank back in her seat with
a quick sigh. The interruption was almost a
relief. The sharp strain of this new-born hope
and doubt and wonder was a pain to her, and
she was glad to wait. The joy that had been
thus held out to her was still to be secured, and
she felt a happy safety in the bright future
before her.</p>

<p>As for Louis, his pulses thrilled with triumphant
hope. All his doubts and misgivings
melted like snow beneath the sweet, confiding
looks and tones that Margaret had vouchsafed
to him this evening. He forgot Charley Somers
and all his old mistrust concerning him,
and felt happy in the present and almost secure
of the future. His ardent blood was
stirred as it had never been before. If Mrs.
Gaston could have looked into his heart to-night,
she could never again have called him
cold and unemotional!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AMES &amp; Gaston had been awarded the
designs for some important buildings, to
be erected at a distance of a few miles from
Washington, and it was in connection with
this matter that Louis Gaston, the morning
after the interview with Miss Trevennon, just
recorded, stepped into a street-car which was
to take him within a short distance of the site
of these buildings.</p>

<p>As he glanced around on entering, he met the
smiling and enticing gaze of Mrs. Vere. There
was a vacant seat beside her, but he did not
choose to take it. His mind, since last night&#8217;s
episode, had been full of memories and anticipations
with which the very thought of Mrs.
Vere was discordant. So he merely raised his
hat, in answer to her greeting, and seated himself
at some distance from her, near the door,
turning his face to the window. But, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
car went on toward the suburbs, the passengers
gradually departed, and he presently became
aware of the fact that only Mrs. Vere and
himself remained. Even then his aversion to
an interview with her, in his present mood,
was so strong that he kept his place, choosing
to ignore the fact of their being left alone together.
In a very few minutes, however, Mrs.
Vere crossed to his side, saying, with an airy
little laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;As the mountain won&#8217;t come to Mahomet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Louis, of course, turned at once and resigned
himself to the inevitable interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what fortunate circumstance am I to
attribute the honor of Mrs. Vere&#8217;s society, so
far outside the pale of civilization?&#8221; he said,
adopting the bantering tone he usually made
use of in talking to Mrs. Vere, in order to veil
his real feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going out to see the Temples,&#8221; she
replied; &#8220;I shall have to walk from the terminus.
It&#8217;s such a nuisance having no carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
and I&#8217;m sure I think I deserve one&mdash;don&#8217;t
you? But what brings you out so far
during business hours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business,&#8221; answered Gaston. &#8220;I am
going to spy out the land for a new building
enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of building enterprise? I
should say a charming cottage, suitable for a
pair of domestic neophytes, designed by the
architect for his own occupancy, if it were not
that a dishevelled young Southerner, with an
eccentric tailor and a beautiful voice, stands in
the way of that idea! I&#8217;m afraid Miss Trevennon,
for all her gentleness, must be rather
cruel; for, judging by superficial evidences,
she has beguiled the wary Mr. Gaston to the
point of a futile hankering after Mr. Somers&#8217;
place. I suppose she has had the conscience
to tell you she&#8217;s engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Trevennon?&#8221; said Louis, meeting her
searching gaze without flinching, though his
heart gave a great leap and then seemed to
stand still. &#8220;She has not made me her confidant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
as to her matrimonial intentions; but if
what you say is true, young Somers is a man I
well might envy, whether I do or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hated the idea of seeming to discuss
Margaret with this woman, and yet he was
burning to hear more. He asked no questions,
feeling sure that he could become possessed of
whatever information Mrs. Vere had, without
that concession on his part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no doubt about its being true,&#8221;
went on Mrs. Vere. &#8220;I happen to know the
Welfords, the people Mr. Somers stayed with,
very well. Mrs. Welford told me all about it. It
seems this young fellow is troubled with a certain
degree of impecuniosity, and he had received
an offer from some people in South
America to come out and join them in some
business enterprise, and so he came on at
once to consult Miss Trevennon; and it was
agreed between them that he should go. The
plan is that he is to return a millionnaire and
marry her. I wonder she hasn&#8217;t told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should she? Ladies are apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
reserved about such matters, however garrulous
a man may think proper to be, and Mr.
Somers, for one, seems to have been sufficiently
communicative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose he only told Mrs. Welford,
and she only told me. You must consider it
confidential.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Louis; &#8220;but here is the
terminus, and we must abandon our equipage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked with her as far as the Temples&#8217;
place, which was a very short distance off, and
then he bowed and left her with unbroken
serenity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vere was a woman who, in point of fact,
was by no means incapable of deep duplicity,
but in the present instance she had been guilty
only of stating as facts what Mrs. Welford had
told her more in the form of conjectures. She
had happened to meet Somers at this friend&#8217;s
house one evening, and had introduced the
topic of Miss Trevennon, adroitly plying the
young man with questions, and had satisfied
herself that he was certainly in love with and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
probably engaged to her. On this basis she
and Mrs. Welford had constructed the story
which she told with such confidence to Gaston.</p>

<p>As for Louis, he made but little headway
with his estimates and prospecting that morning.
His first impulse had been to disbelieve
this story, and the remembrance of Margaret&#8217;s
looks and tones as he had talked with her last
night made it seem almost incredible. But
then, as he looked back into the past, he
recalled the incident of the pressed flower, and
the emotion Margaret had shown on hearing
Mr. Somers sing that Christmas night, and the
long interview that followed next morning,
and, more than all, the traces of tears he had
afterward detected; and, as he thought of all
these things, his heart grew very heavy.</p>

<p>He soon resolved that he would go at once
to Margaret, and learn the truth from her own
lips.</p>

<p>When he reached the house, he found
Thomas engaged in polishing the brasses of
the front door, which stood partly open. Being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
informed by him that Miss Trevennon was
in the drawing-room alone, he stepped softly
over the carpeted hall and entered the library.
From there he could see Margaret, seated on a
low ottoman before the fire, her hands clasped
around her knees, and her eyes fixed meditatively
upon the glowing coals. How his young
blood leaped at the sight of her! How lovely
and gentle she looked! Was she not the very
joy of his heart, and delight of his eyes?
Where was another like her?</p>

<p>He stood a moment silently observing her,
and then he cautiously drew nearer, treading
with great care, and shielding himself behind a
large screen that stood at one side of the fire-place.
In this way he was able to come very
near without having his approach suspected.
He meant to get very close and then to speak
her name, and see if he could call up again the
sweet, almost tender regard with which she had
looked at him last night. Somehow, he felt
sure that he should see that look again. He
had half forgotten Charley Somers and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Vere. He kept his position in silence a moment.
It was a joy just to feel himself near
her, and to know that by just putting out his
hand he might touch her. His eager gaze
was fixed upon her fair, sweet profile, and
sought the lovely eyes which were still gazing
into the fire. He could see their musing,
wistful look, and, as he began to wonder what
it meant, those gentle eyes became suffused
with tears. He saw them rise and fill and
overflow the trembling lids, and fall upon a
letter in her lap. At sight of that letter his
heart contracted, and a sudden pallor over-spread
his face. He had been so uncontrollably
drawn to her that, in another moment, the
burning words of love must have been spoken,
and the eager arms outstretched to clasp her
to his heart. But this letter was in a man&#8217;s
handwriting, and his keen eyes detected the
South American stamp on the envelope. His
blood seemed to congeal within him, and his
face grew hard and cold.</p>

<p>He stepped backward, with an effort to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
escape, but his wits seemed to have deserted
him; he stumbled against a chair, and, at the
sound, Margaret looked up. Oh, <i>why</i> were
his eyes so blindly turned away from her?
<i>Why</i> did he not see that ardent, happy look
with which she recognized him? Surely it
was all and more than memory pictured it!
Surely then he must have known, beyond a
doubt, that her whole heart bade him welcome!</p>

<p>But he would not look at her. He turned to
make his way out, as he had come, pausing
merely to ask, with resolutely averted eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, but can you tell me where Eugenia
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In her dressing-room, I think,&#8221; said Margaret,
in a voice that, in spite of her, was
husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to her,&#8221; he said, and, without
another word or look, he walked away.</p>

<p>Poor Margaret! Her heart was sore and
troubled at the sad words of Charley Somers&#8217;
note. In her own state of happiness and hope,
they struck her as a thousand times more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
touching. She felt restless and uneasy, and
she would have given much for some slight
sign of protecting care and tenderness from
Louis. She was ready to relinquish everything
for him. She knew that he could make up to
her for the loss of all else; but although he
must have seen that she was troubled, he could
bear to leave her with that air of cold composure!
A dreadful doubt and uncertainty seized
upon her, and she went to her room feeling
lonely and dispirited.</p>

<p>There was to be a large ball that night, and
it was not until Margaret came down to dinner,
and observed that Mr. Gaston&#8217;s place was vacant,
that she learned from Cousin Eugenia
that he had excused himself from both dinner
and the ball. She did not ask for any explanation,
and Mrs. Gaston only said that she
supposed he had work to finish. No one took
any special heed of his absence, but Margaret
remembered that it was her last dinner
with them, and felt hurt that he should
have absented himself; the ball was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
bereft of all its delight. She knew there was
something wrong, and her heart sank at the
thought that there might be no opportunity
for explanation between them. But then she
remembered the unfinished sentence that General
Gaston&#8217;s entrance had interrupted the
night before, and she felt sure that all must
come right in the end.</p>

<p>Animated by this strong conviction, and remembering
that she would not leave until late
in the afternoon of the next day, she dressed
for the ball in a beautiful toilet of Cousin Eugenia&#8217;s
contriving, composed of white silk and
swan&#8217;s-down, resolved to throw off these fancied
doubts and misgivings as far as possible. In
spite of all, however&mdash;though Cousin Eugenia
went into ecstacies over her appearance, and
she had more suitors for her notice than she
could have remembered afterward&mdash;the evening
was long and wearisome to her, and she was
glad when Cousin Eugenia came to carry her
off rather early, in anticipation of the fatigues
of the next day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>When they reached home there was a bright
light in the library, and Louis was sitting at
the table writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Louis?&#8221; said Mrs. Gaston,
calling to him from the hall: &#8220;Margaret must
give you an account of the ball, for I am too
utterly worn out. Go, Margaret&mdash;and lest you
should not mention it, I&#8217;ll preface your account
by saying that Miss Trevennon was, by all
odds, the beauty and belle of the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words she vanished up the staircase,
whither her husband had preceded her.</p>

<p>Half glad and half timid, Margaret advanced
toward the centre of the room, and when Louis
stood up to receive her, she could not help
observing how careworn and grave he looked.
There was a troubled expression in his face that
touched her very much. Something had happened
since last night. She felt more than ever
sure of it; and it was something that had
stirred him deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad the last ball was such a successful
one,&#8221; he said, placing a chair for her, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
then, going over to the mantel, he stood and
faced her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a beautiful ball,&#8221; said Margaret;
&#8220;the rooms were exquisite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they supplied with mirrors?&#8221; he
asked, folding his arms as he looked down
at her, steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mirrors? Oh yes; there were plenty of
mirrors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you make use of them, I wonder,
Miss Trevennon? Do you know just how you
look, in that beautiful soft gown, with the
lovely white fur around your neck and arms?
I should fancy it might tempt one to the mermaid
fashion of carrying a mirror at the
girdle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled as he spoke&mdash;a resolute, odd
smile that had little merriment in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing, all this time?&#8221;
she asked, wishing to lead the conversation
away from herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Working,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;writing letters&mdash;doing
sums&mdash;drawing plans.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>&#8220;How you love your work!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I love my work, thank God!&#8221; he answered,
in a fervid tone. &#8220;It has been my
best friend all my life, and all my dreams for
the future are in it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love it almost too much, I think. It
takes you away from everything else. Do you
mean to work in this way always? Have you
no other visions of the future?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have had visions!&#8221; he said, thrusting
his hands into the pockets of his sack-coat,
and bracing himself against the end of
the mantel, while he looked at her steadily as
he spoke. &#8220;I have had visions&mdash;plenty of
them! They mostly took the form of very
simple, quiet dreams of life; for I have already
told you, Miss Trevennon, by what a very
demon of domesticity I am haunted. The
sweetest of all thoughts to me is that of home&mdash;a
quiet life, with a dear companion&mdash;that
would be my happiness. Exterior things
would be very unimportant.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to rouse himself, as if from some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
sort of lethargy which he dreaded, and, standing
upright, he folded his arms across his
breast, and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I had this vision once, I have put it
from me now, and only the old routine remains&mdash;business
and reading and a half-hearted interest
in society. There is music, but that I
mistrust; it brings the old visions back, and
shows me the loneliness of a life in which they
can have no part. So it is no wonder, is it,
that I call my work my best friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor, poor Margaret! Her heart sank
lower and lower, and when he finished with
this calmly uttered question, a little shudder
ran through her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am cold,&#8221; she said, rising; &#8220;I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went and brought her white wrap from
where she had thrown it on a chair, and with
one of his peculiarly protecting motions he
threw it around her. Then, gathering the soft
folds in his hands on each side, he drew them
close across her breast, and held them so a
moment, as he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>&#8220;Yes, Margaret, you must go. And it is not
for the night, nor for the season, nor even for
the year; it is forever. What would you say
to me, if you knew we were never to see each
other again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely we never shall,&#8221; she said,
speaking in a cold, vacant way.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will you say to me? What will
you give me to remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say good-bye,&#8221; she answered in
the same dull tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, then, Margaret. Good-bye,
good-bye, good-bye; and may God Almighty
bless you,&#8221; he said, and she felt the hands that
rested against hers trembling. He looked long
and searchingly into her face, with a scrutinizing
steady gaze, as if he would photograph upon
his mind its every line and feature. And then
the light folds of her wrap were loosened, his
hands fell heavily to his side, and he stepped
back from her.</p>

<p>Like a woman walking in her sleep she
passed him, her long draperies trailing heavily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
after her as she crossed the hall and began to
ascend the stairs. Her step was heavy and
she moved slowly, and Louis, watching her
from below with eyes that were wild with longing
and lips that were stern with repression,
held his breath in passionate expectation that,
as she turned at the bend of the stairs, she
might give him one last look. But her eyes,
as the sweet profile came in view, were looking
straight before her, and the tall white-clad
figure was almost out of sight when, without
willing it, without meaning it, absolutely without
knowing it, he arrested her by a hurried,
half-articulate call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; he cried, in a voice that seemed
not to be his own, so strange and altered was it.</p>

<p>The weary figure paused, and she turned and
looked down at him. A little glimmer of the
bright joy, which had been so lately smothered
out of life, shot up in her heart as she heard him
call her name, but when she looked at him, it
died. He was standing with his arms folded
tightly together, and a look of the most rigid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
self-control in his whole aspect. A man that
loved her could never look at her like that, she
thought, and she felt at that instant, more than
ever, that she had deceived herself. Complete
weariness seemed to master her. Her chief
feeling was that she was tired to death. What
was the use of going back?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you,&#8221; said
Louis, in a voice that was colder than it had
been yet. &#8220;Come back, for a moment only.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very weak, and it seemed easier to
comply than to refuse; so, very silently and
slowly, Margaret retraced her steps.</p>

<p>As the beautiful white vision drew nearer,
step by step, the young man&#8217;s whole heart and
soul went out to meet her, but at the same
moment his physical frame retreated, and he
withdrew into the room before her, conscious
only that he still held possession of himself, and
that the spirit within him was still master of
the body. Long habit had accustomed him to
frequent renunciation. All these years he had
been resisting and overcoming, in smaller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
things, with the conscious knowledge that he
was thereby acquiring power which would
enable him to conquer when greater temptations
should come. And now he knew that his
mightiest temptation was hard upon him.</p>

<p>He pressed his arms tighter together across
his breast, set his lips and held his breath, as
his temptation, clad in a wondrous long white
garment, wafting a sweet fragrance and waking
a murmuring silken sound, came near to him,
and passed him by.</p>

<p>When Margaret had actually moved away
from him, and thrown herself weakly into a
low, deep chair, and he realized that his arms
were still folded, his lips still set, he drew
in his breath, with a long respiration that
seemed to draw into his heart a mortal pain;
and he knew that his practice had stood him in
good stead, and that his strength had proved
sufficient in his hour of need.</p>

<p>It would have been only for a moment. All
he wanted was to take her in his arms an
instant, and kiss her just once, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
could have let her go forever, and counted himself
a happy man to have lived that moment&#8217;s
life. That was all; but that he felt himself in
honor bound to renounce, because he believed
her to be pledged to another man. And he
had accomplished the renunciation; but now
that this was so, he felt an impatient rebellion
against further discipline. The resistless torrent
of his love and despair rushed over him,
and nothing should keep him from speaking!
Words could do her no harm, and there were
words that burnt upon his lips, whose utterance
alone, it seemed to him, could keep his
brain from bursting.</p>

<p>He opened his lips to speak, but the words
refused to come. There was a spell in the
silence that he felt powerless to break. The
room was absolutely free from either sound or
motion. Margaret had dropped her weary
body sideways in the cushioned chair, with her
long white robe sweeping behind her, and her
face turned from him, so that only her profile
was in view.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>The young man stood and looked at her,
possessed by the sense of her nearness, enthralled
by the spell of her beauty. He could
see the rise and fall of her bosom under its covering
of silk and fur, and there was a dejectedness
in her attitude that made a passionate appeal
to his tenderness. She was very pale, and
her lowered lids and a little drooping at the
corners of her mouth gave her lovely face a
most plaintive look. She was tired too; the
inertness of the pliant figure, with the motionless
bare arms and relaxed, half-open hands,
showed that plainly enough. Fragile and
slight and weary as she was, how could she
endure the battle of life alone, and who, of all
men in the world, could strive and struggle
for her as he could? The thought of her
woman&#8217;s weakness was a keen delight to him
at that moment. He had never felt himself
so strong. With a quick motion that
emphasized his thought, without interrupting
the stillness, he threw out his right arm
and clinched his hand with a conscious pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
in his strength. Nerves and veins and
muscles seemed to tingle with sentient animal
force.</p>

<p>All these excited thoughts passed through
his brain with lightning-like swiftness, but
now, at last, the silence was broken by a
sound. It was a very gentle one&mdash;a short,
faint sigh from Margaret; but its effect was
powerful. It roused the young man from his
absorption and recalled him to reality.</p>

<p>He sat down a little space away from her,
and with his fervid eyes fixed on her pale profile
and lowered lids, began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an impulse, not a deliberate purpose,
that made me call you back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
should perhaps have done better to let you go,
but I did not, and now you are here, and I am
here, and we are alone in the stillness together,
Margaret, and you will have to listen to what I
have to say. I think you must know what it
is. My efforts to keep the truth out of my
eyes when I looked at you, and out of my voice
when I spoke to you, have seemed to me miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
failures many a time, and I dare say you
have known it all along.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, still looking at her.
There was not a quiver in the still face pressed
against the cushions, but at his last words the
beautiful arm was uplifted and laid against her
cheek, hiding her face from view, as the slim
hand closed upon the top of the chair, above
her head. It was an attitude full of grace.
The white wrap had fallen back, leaving bare
the lovely arms and shoulders, and revealing
perfectly the symmetry of the rounded figure.
Although the face was hidden, he could see
every exquisite line and tint of it, in his mind&#8217;s
eye, almost as plainly as he saw, with his actual
vision, the soft masses of hair drawn back from
the little shell-like ear, and the portion of white
cheek and throat which her screening arm did
not conceal.</p>

<p>In spite of strong repression, the hot blood
overflowed the young man&#8217;s bounding heart and
sent a glow of dark color surging over his face.
Something&mdash;a little fluttered movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
breast&mdash;revealed to his confused consciousness
that Margaret herself was not unmoved. He
rose and advanced toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but let me put into
words the sweet, despairing truth. I love you,
Margaret. Oh, good and beautiful and true
and sweet, how could I choose but love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped upon his knees before her, and
in this low position he could see her lovely,
tremulous lips. At something in their expression
a sudden little flame of hope shot up in
his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret,&#8221; he said, in a deep, commanding
tone that was almost stern, while all the time
his hands were clinched together, so that he
touched not so much as the hem of her dress&mdash;&#8220;Margaret,
look at me. Let me see straight
into your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no disobeying that tone, which
he now used to her for the first time. She felt
herself mastered by it, and, lowering her arm,
she showed to him her loving eyes, her trembling lips,
her entranced and radiant face.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
Instantly his arms were around her, his lips to
hers, in an embrace so tender, a kiss so sweet,
as can come only in that rare union of freshness
and completeness for which all the past
lives of these two young souls had been a
preparation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were wrong. I did <i>not</i> know,&#8221; she
said, presently, breaking the long silence and
murmuring the words very softly in his
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have been dull and blind and deaf,
my darling, my darling, my darling!&#8221; he said,
lingering caressingly upon the repetition of the
poor little word, which is the best we have to
convey the tenderest message of our hearts.
&#8220;Do you know it now, or do you need to have
it proved to you still further? Let me look at
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she would not lift her head from its safe
and happy resting-place, and her eyes refused
to meet his until he said again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret,&#8221; in that stern, sweet voice which
thrilled and conquered her; and then she lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
up her eyes, and fixed them with a fervent gaze
on his.</p>

<p>&#8220;God help me to deserve you, Margaret, my
saint,&#8221; he murmured, as he met that look of
lovely exaltation. &#8220;It hurts me that you have
to stoop so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not stoop,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You have
pointed me to heights I never dreamed of. We
will try to reach them together.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, when their long talk, including the
short explanation of their misunderstanding,
was over, and they were parting for the night,
with the blessed consciousness that they would
meet to-morrow in the same sweet companionship&mdash;with
the thought in the mind of each
that the future was to be always together,
never apart, Louis went with her into the
hall, to watch her again as she ascended the
stairs.</p>

<p>When she had gone but a few steps, she
paused, leaning over the banister:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it seem funny,&#8221; she said, the serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
happiness her face had worn giving place
to a merry smile, &#8220;such a Yankee and such a
Rebel, as you and I! Let us set an example
of letting by-gones be by-gones, and shake
hands across the bloody chasm!&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
